<h1>Indoctrination</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li><sc>Indoctrination</sc> is limited to once per ground combat.</li>
    <li>If an invasion involves ground combats on multiple planets, <sc>Indoctrination</sc> may be used at the start of each of them.</li>
    <li>If the Yin player&rsquo;s opponent only has mechs in the ground combat, <sc>Indoctrination</sc> cannot be used.</li>
    <ol><li>If the Yin player is in a combat with the Naalu player, and the Naalu player is using their flagship ability to commit only fighters to the ground combat, <sc>Indoctrination</sc> cannot be used.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Devotion</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When resolving <sc>Devotion</sc>, the Yin player chooses which ships are destroyed.</li>
    <ol><li>The Yin cannot choose their own ships as targets.</li></ol>
    <li>Effects that cancel hits, such as the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability, cannot be used to prevent ships from being destroyed.</li>
    <li>If a player retreats, the Yin player will be unable to use <sc>Devotion</sc> to destroy an opponent&rsquo;s ship.</li>
    <li>If the Yin player is in a combat with the N&rsquo;orr player, then the two players will alternate when resolving end of combat round abilities, starting with the attacker.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Greyfire Mutagen <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Leader abilities, mech abilities and flagship abilities are not faction abilities.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Greyfire Mutagen &Omega; <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A player may receive <i>Greyfire Mutagen &Omega;</i> in a transaction during a ground combat. If received at the start of ground combat, that player may play it immediately.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>A transaction must involve the active player. As such, the defender will be unable to received <i>Greyfire Mutagen &Omega;</i>.</li>
        <li>The active player may perform a transaction with each other player at most once per turn. As such, the active player cannot receive <i>Greyfire Mutagen &Omega;</i> more than once per turn.</li>
        <li>If the active player received <i>Greyfire Mutagen &Omega;</i> on a previous turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Yin player to regain it. However, <i>Greyfire Mutagen &Omega;</i> cannot be played twice in one timing window. The active player cannot play <i>Greyfire Mutagen &Omega;</i> again during the same ground combat.</li>
        <li>If an invasion involves ground combat on multiple planets, <i>Greyfire Mutagen &Omega;</i> may be played at the start of each of them.</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Impulse Core <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When resolving <i>Impulse Core</i>, the Yin player&rsquo;s opponent chooses which ships are destroyed.</li>
    <li>Effects that cancel hits, such as the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability, may be used to cancel a hit produced by <i>Impulse Core</i>.</li>
    <li><i>Impulse Core</i> will resolve before the <b>Anti&ndash;Fighter Barrage</b> step of a space combat. As such, any destroyed destroyers will not make an anti&ndash;fighter barrage roll.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Yin Spinner <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The infantry may be placed on a planet that does not contain a unit with <sc>Production</sc>.</li>
    <li>Other effects that produce units without a unit using its <sc>Production</sc> ability will not trigger <i>Yin Spinner</i>.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Yin Spinner &Omega; <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The two infantry must be placed together.</li>
    <li>Other effects that produce units without a unit using its <sc>Production</sc> ability will trigger <i>Yin Spinner &Omega;</i>.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Van Hauge <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When the <i>Van Hauge</i> is destroyed, it will not destroy any of the Saar player&rsquo;s Floating Factories present in the system.</li>
    <li>The <i>Van Hauge</i> will not destroy ground forces in the system. However, each player must then remove ground forces, if necessary, from the space area of that system to meet capacity limits.</li>
    <li>As both players will have zero ships in the active system after the Van Hauge is destroyed, the combat will end in a draw.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Brother Milor <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If all of a player&rsquo;s ships are destroyed during combat, they may still place ships with this ability. If they do, combat will continue.</li>
    <ol><li>If that player&rsquo;s opponent has no ships remaining, that player will instead win that combat.</li></ol>
    <li>Capacity is not checked during combat. As such a player may use Brother Milor to place fighters into a space combat where they have no spare capacity. After that combat ends, that player must remove fighters and/or ground forces to meet their capacity limit in that system.</li>
    <li>If the Yin player uses Brother Milor after the <i>Van Hauge</i> is destroyed during a space combat, they will win that combat.</li>
    <li>If all ships in the system are destroyed, and there are excess hits that have not been assigned to a ship, those hits will lapse, and cannot be assigned to the newly placed fighters.</li>
    <li>If all ships in the system are destroyed by hits produced from a space cannon roll, the player that produced those hits may score the <i>Turn Their Fleets to Dust</i> secret objective before the new fighters are placed.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Brother Omar <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the <i>Regulated Conscription</i> law is in play, the Yin player may produce two infantry for one resource. This will count one towards their <sc>Production</sc> limit.</li>
    <li>If a game effect instructs the Yin player to produce ships without using the <sc>Production</sc> ability, they may only produce infantry fighters if that game effect allows them to produce infantry.</li>
    <li>The Yin player may choose to produce one infantry for one resource. If they do, they may produce one additional infantry.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Dannel of the Tenth &mdash; Spinner Overdrive <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Yin player may ready a planet they control containing zero infantry.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Moyin&rsquo;s Ashes <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A <sc>Deploy</sc> ability may only be resolved for units in a player&rsquo;s reinforcements. If all four Moyin&rsquo;s Ashes are already on the board, no more may be deployed.</li>
    <ol><li>If a Moyin&rsquo;s Ashes is destroyed during combat, another may be deployed in a later combat during the same invasion.</li></ol>
    <li>The removed unit must still be an infantry.</li>
    <li>The <sc>Deploy</sc> ability has a total cost of three influence. The Yin player may exhaust a single planet with three or more influence to pay this cost.</li>
