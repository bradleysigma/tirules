    <li>If the Yin player&rsquo;s opponent only has mechs in the ground combat, <sc>Indoctrination</sc> cannot be used.</li>
    <ol><li>If the Yin player is in a combat with the Naalu player, and the Naalu player is using the ability of their flagship, the <i>Matriarch</i>, to commit only fighters to the ground combat, <sc>Indoctrination</sc> cannot be used.</li></ol>
    <li>If the last of a player&rsquo;s ground forces in a ground combat are removed by <sc>Indoctrination</sc>, that player loses the combat immediately. They will be unable to use any &ldquo;start of combat&rdquo; abilities.</li>

    <ol class="note">
    <li>When resolving <i>Impulse Core</i>, the Yin player&rsquo;s opponent chooses which ships are destroyed.</li>
    <li>Effects that cancel hits, such as the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability, may be used to cancel a hit produced by <i>Impulse Core</i>.</li>
    <li><i>Impulse Core</i> will resolve before the <b>Anti&ndash;Fighter Barrage</b> step of a space combat. As such, any destroyed destroyers will not make an anti&ndash;fighter barrage roll.</li>

    </ol>

<h1>Brother Milor <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If all of a player&rsquo;s ships are destroyed during combat, they may still place ships with this ability. If they do, combat will continue.</li>
    <ol><li>If that player&rsquo;s opponent has no ships remaining, that player will instead win that combat.</li></ol>
    <li>Capacity is not checked during combat. As such a player may use Brother Milor to place fighters into a space combat where they have no spare capacity. After that combat ends, that player must remove fighters and/or ground forces to meet their capacity limit in that system.</li>
    <li>If the Yin player uses Brother Milor after the <i>Van Hauge</i> is destroyed during a space combat, they will win that combat.</li>

<h1>Brother Omar <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
