<style> .lrr > li:before, .lrr > h2 > li:before {content: '41.' counter(item, decimal);} </style>
<p>A gravity rift is an anomaly that affects movement.</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
    <li>A ship that will move out of or through a gravity rift at any time during its movement, applies +1 to its move value.</li>
    <ol><li>This can allow a ship to reach the active system from farther away than it normally could.</li></ol>
    <li>For each ship that would move out of or through a gravity rift, one die is rolled immediately before it exits the gravity rift system; on a result of 1&ndash;3, that ship is removed from the board.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice are not rolled for units that are being transported by ships that have capacity.</li>
        <li>Units that are being transported are removed from the board if the ship transporting them is removed from the board.</li>
        <li>Units that are removed are returned to the player&rsquo;s reinforcements.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>A gravity rift can affect the same ship multiple times during a single movement.</li>
    <li>A system that contains multiple gravity rifts is treated as a single gravity rift.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Notes</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Moving into a gravity rift will not provide the +1, nor will the ships have to roll for removal.</li>
    <li>A ship removed by a gravity rift is not destroyed.</li>
    <li>All ship movement must be declared before any roll for gravity rift removal. A player may not move additional ships after seeing the result of this roll.</li>
    <li>A ship that is removed by a gravity rift will not count toward the fleet limit in the destination system.</li>
    <li>Retreating from a gravity rift will result in the following:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The retreating player must declare which, if any, Fighter II are moving themselves and which are being transported, and in which ships.</li>
        <li>Each non&ndash;fighter ship and each Fighter II moving itself will have to roll for removal.</li>
        <li>The +1 will have no effect, as retreats are restricted to adjacent systems.</li>
        <li>If all ships are lost to the rift, the retreating player will not place a command token in the destination system.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>If a ship moves through or out of multiple gravity rifts, and/or the same gravity rift multiple times, each instance will provide a +1 to movement, and requires a separate roll for removal.</li>
    <li>If a ship with capacity would transport another unit after moving out of or through a gravity rift, but is removed, that unit remains where it is.</li>
    <li>A system containing a Vuil&rsquo;raith Dimensional Tear is a gravity rift, and thus an anomaly.</li>
    <li>A future rule change will place the ship movement restrictions of anomalies upon all units.</li>
    </ol>
