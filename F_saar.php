<h1>Scavenge</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the Saar player gains control of multiple planets during one invasion, the trade goods are gained one at a time.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Nomadic</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    </ol>

<h1>Ragh&rsquo;s Call <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Any PDS on the planet remain. They might produce hits during the <b>Space Cannon Defense</b> step.</li>
    <li>All of the Saar player&rsquo;s ground forces must be placed on the same planet.</li>
    <li>Any damaged mechs remain damaged.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Chaos Mapping <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The produced unit must be paid for.</li>
    <li>The produced unit may move later that same turn, if the Saar player performs a tactical action.</li>
    <li>A unit may be produced on each of the Saar player&rsquo;s turns; <i>Chaos Mapping</i> is not exhausted.</li>
    <ol><li>A unit may be produced on the turn the Saar player passes.</li></ol>
    <li>A player may still use abilities such as <sc>Deep Space Cannon</sc> that affect the Saar player&rsquo;s units located in asteroid fields.</li>
    <li>If an asteroid field contains non&ndash;ship units belonging to the Saar player, it may still be activated by other players.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Floating Factory <sub>(Unit)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When a Floating Factory produces ground forces, they may be placed in the space area or on a planet they control in that system.</li>
    <li>Hits produced by space cannon rolls cannot be assigned to a Floating Factory.</li>
    <li>Game effects that affect ship movement, such as the <i>Gravity Drive</i> technology, the <i>Flank Speed</i> action card, the <i>Light/Wave Deflector</i> technology, the <i>Antimass Deflectors</i> technology, etc, may affect Floating Factories.</li>
    <li>A Floating Factory moving through or out of a gravity rift must roll for removal. It will receive the +1 to its movement.</li>
    <li>If the Saar player announces a retreat during a space combat, but all their ships are destroyed that round, any Floating Factories in that system are destroyed without retreating.</li>
    <ol><li>If neither player has ships in the active system after the final round of combat, the Floating Factory is not destroyed, and does not retreat.</li></ol>
    <li>When resolving an ability of the <i>Construction</i> strategy card, the Saar player must control a planet in the system they place a Floating Factory in.</li>
    <li>If an effect allows Floating Factory to move through a system that contains another player&rsquo;s ships (such as the <i>Light/Wave Deflectors</i> technology), it will not be blockaded in systems it moves through.</li>
    <li>If a Floating Factory is in a system that contains none of the Saar player&rsquo;s ships, and another player moves ships into that system, the Floating is immediately destroyed.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>This will happen before the <b>Space Cannon Offense</b> step. The Floating Factory is destroyed, even if all of the other player&rsquo; ships are destroyed during this step.</li>
        <li>If all of the other player&rsquo;s ships are removed due to a gravity rift, they will not arrive in the active system. The Floating Factory will not be destroyed.</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Son of Ragh <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    </ol>

<h1>Captain Mendosa <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Saar player does not decide to use this ability until after the other player has activated a system. Any deal made to use this ability before the system has been activated is non&ndash;binding.</li>
    <li>The effect of Captain Mendosa occurs when the system is activated. The move value will be set to the chosen ship&rsquo;s move value during this window.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Move value modifying effects that trigger after a system is activated, such as the <i>Flank Speed</i> action card or the <i>Gravity Drive</i> technology will not be included in Captain Mendosa&rsquo;s effect.</li></ol>
        <li>Gravity rifts apply the +1 during movement. This modifier will not be included in Captain Mendosa&rsquo;s effect.</li></ol>
    </li>
    <li>The nebula effect of setting the move value of all ships in that system to one will be overwritten by Captain Mendosa&rsquo;s effect.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Rowl Sarring <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    </ol>

<h1>Gurno Aggero &mdash; Armageddon Relay <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A unit is not adjacent to the system it is in.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Scavenger Zeta <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The trade good gained by Scavenge may be spent for the <sc>Deploy</sc> ability.</li>
    <li>Exploration will resolve before this ability may trigger.</li>
    <li>If the Saar player gains control of multiple planets, they may deploy one Scavenger Zeta to each.</li>
