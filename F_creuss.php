<h1>Quantum Entanglement</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The effect of the <i>Enforced Travel Ban</i> law does not affect the Creuss player.</li>
    <li>If the Creuss player has units or controls planets in a system with an alpha wormhole, and another player has units or controls planets in a system with an beta wormhole, or vice versa, then the Creuss player and that player are neighbors.</li>
    <ol><li>The Mentak player may use their <sc>Pillage</sc> ability against the Creuss player in this manner.</li></ol>
    <li>If Mecatol Rex contains an alpha wormhole, then the for effect of the <i>Ixthian Artifact</i> agenda will not affect the Creuss player&rsquo;s units in a system with a beta wormhole (and no alpha wormhole), and vice versa.</li>
    <li>The Creuss player&rsquo;s <sc>Quantum Entanglement</sc> ability applies to their units with the <sc>Deep Space Cannon</sc> ability. Other players cannot use <sc>Quantum Entanglement</sc> to produce hits from a unit with the <sc>Deep Space Cannon</sc> ability against the Creuss player&rsquo;s units.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Slipstream</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li><sc>Slipstream</sc> does not apply to the Creuss Gate or to the <i>Hil Colish</i>, or to gamma wormholes.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Creuss Gate</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A frontier token is placed in the Creuss Gate system during setup.</li>
    <li>Both the Creuss Gate and the Creuss home system (in standard game board setups) are on the edge of the board.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Creuss IFF <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A player may receive the <i>Creuss IFF</i> in a transaction during their turn. If received at the start of that player&rsquo;s turn, that player may play it immediately.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The active player may perform a transaction with each other player at most once per turn. As such, the active player cannot receive the <i>Creuss IFF</i> more than once per turn.</li>
        <li>If the active player received the <i>Creuss IFF</i> on a previous turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Creuss player to regain it. However, the <i>Creuss IFF</i> cannot be played twice in one timing window. The active player cannot play the <i>Creuss IFF</i> again until their next turn.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Any deal between the Creuss player and another player regarding where the wormhole tokens will be placed, if made before the <i>Creuss IFF</i> is exchanged, is non&ndash;binding.</li>
    <li>The Creuss IFF may be played even if the Creuss player has not researched <i>Wormhole Generator</i>.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Dimensional Splicer <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Any wormhole may trigger <i>Dimensional Splicer</i>, including the <i>Hil Colish</i></li>
    <li>One hit will be produced even if the system contains multiple wormholes.</li>
    <li>The Creuss player chooses which ship the hit is assigned to.</li>
    <li>The <i>Shields Holding</i> action card may be used to cancel the hit.</li>
    <li>The chosen ship may cancel the hit by using its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability, if present. A different ship with the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability cannot do so.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If the chosen ship does so, the <i>Direct Hit</i> and/or <i>Reflective Shielding</i> action cards may be used.</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Wormhole Generator <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>This ability is mandatory for the Creuss player in every status phase after it has been researched.</li>
    <ol><li>The Creuss player may move a wormhole token from the system it is in into the same system.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Hil Colish <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the <i>Hil Colish</i> moves first, then the Creuss player uses the <i>Hil Colish</i>&rsquo;s new position when determining if the active system may be reached by their other ships.</li>
    <li>If the <i>Hil Colish</i> moves first, but is removed due to the effect of a gravity rift, then ships that move later cannot use its wormhole.</li>
    <li>If the <i>Hil Colish</i> moves last, then it may move itself into (or though, if its move value is increased) the Creuss Gate or Creuss home system. Before it does so, the Creuss player&rsquo;s other ships may move through the wormhole in the <i>Hil Colish</i>&rsquo;s system.</li>
    <li>If the <i>Hil Colish</i> moves before or after other ships, it does not generate a second <b>Space Cannon Offense</b> step.</li>
    <li>A unit with the <sc>Deep Space Cannon</sc> ability may produce hits in systems adjacent to that unit via the delta wormhole in the <i>Hil Colish</i>&rsquo;s system.</li>
    <li>If an effect allows another player to move through a system that contains the Creuss player&rsquo;s ships (such as the <i>Light/Wave Deflector</i> technology), that player may move through the delta wormhole in the <i>Hil Colish</i>&rsquo;s system.</li>
    <li>When the <i>Hil Colish</i> retreats, it may retreat before or after the Creuss player&rsquo;s other ships, but cannot retreat in such a way that would prevent the other ships from retreating to the same system.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Emissary Taivra <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Creuss player may use this ability to access the inactive wormhole nexus without a gamma wormhole. Moving ships into the wormhole nexus this way will cause it to flip.</li>
    <li>A delta wormhole in the system (such as from the <i>Hil Colish</i>) does not prevent this ability from being usable.</li>
    <li>If this ability is used, the active system will be adjacent to systems with delta wormholes.</li>
    <li>This ability does not cause the active system to contain a wormhole. <i>Dimensional Splicer</i> cannot be used in the system unless it already contained a wormhole.</li>
    <li>If a ship moves from the system containing the Ion Storm, it will not flip, unless the active player may move ships through the Ion Storm wormhole and chooses to do so.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Sai Seravus <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The fighters are placed one at a time, until either one has been placed for each ship with capacity that moved through a wormhole, or the capacity of the system is reached.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The Creuss player cannot remove a ground force to create capacity for a fighter.</li>
        <li>If the Creuss player has the Fighter II unit upgrade technology, they may count some of the fighters they place towards their fleet supply (without removing any other ships) in order to continue placing fighters.</li>
        <li>If the Creuss player has a space dock in the active system, they may consider some of the fighters they place as held by the space dock, in order to continue placing fighters.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>This ability may be used whenever the Creuss player&rsquo;s ships move, not just during the movement step of a tactical action.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>While this ability may be used when the Creuss player retreats, retreating will leave no capacity in the active system.</li>
        <li>If the Mahact player uses their <i>Benediction</i> hero ability to move the Creuss player&rsquo;s ships, then the Creuss player may use this ability.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>A ship may move out of a system and back into the same system during tactical action movement, if its move value is high enough. If the Creuss player does this with a ship with capacity, and moves in this manner via a wormhole, they may place a fighter, if possible.</li>
    <li>When the Creuss player moves a ship through a wormhole and into a third system that contains an alpha or beta wormhole and unlocks Sai Seravus, they cannot apply its ability to that movement.</li>
    <ol><li>If the Creuss player moves the <i>Hil Colish</i> separately from other ships during the same <b>Move Ships</b> step, Sai Seravus cannot unlock until all movement is completed.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Riftwalker Meian &mdash; Singularity Reactor <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Any units and tokens on either system are moved with their system.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Icarus Drive <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Icarus Drive does not have to be in the activated system.</li>
    <li>The wormhole token is placed in the system the Icarus Drive was in.</li>
    </ol>
