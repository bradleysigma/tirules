<h1>Quantum Entanglement</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The effect of the <i>Enforced Travel Ban</i> law does not affect the Creuss player.</li>
    <li>If the Creuss player has units or controls planets in a system with an alpha wormhole, and another player has units or controls planets in a system with an beta wormhole, or vice versa, then the Creuss player and that player are neighbors.</li>
    <ol><li>The Mentak player may use their <sc>Pillage</sc> ability against the Creuss player in this manner.</li></ol>
    <li>If Mecatol Rex contains an alpha wormhole, then the for effect of the <i>Ixthian Artifact</i> agenda will not affect the Creuss player&rsquo;s units in a system with a beta wormhole (and no alpha wormhole), and vice versa.</li>
    <li>The Creuss player&rsquo;s <sc>Quantum Entanglement</sc> ability applies to their units with the <sc>Deep Space Cannon</sc> ability. Other players cannot use <sc>Quantum Entanglement</sc> to produce hits from a unit with the <sc>Deep Space Cannon</sc> ability against the Creuss player&rsquo;s units.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Slipstream</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li><sc>Slipstream</sc> does not apply to the Creuss Gate or to the <i>Hil Colish</i>, or to gamma wormholes.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Creuss Gate</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A frontier token is placed in the Creuss Gate system during setup.</li>
    <li>Both the Creuss Gate and the Creuss home system (in standard game board setups) are on the edge of the board.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Creuss IFF <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A player may receive the <i>Creuss IFF</i> in a transaction during their turn. If received at the start of that player&rsquo;s turn, that player may play it immediately.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The active player may perform a transaction with each other player at most once per turn. As such, the active player cannot receive the <i>Creuss IFF</i> more than once per turn.</li>
        <li>If the active player received the <i>Creuss IFF</i> on a previous turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Creuss player to regain it. However, the <i>Creuss IFF</i> cannot be played twice in one timing window. The active player cannot play the <i>Creuss IFF</i> again until their next turn.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Any deal between the Creuss player and another player regarding where the wormhole tokens will be placed, if made before the <i>Creuss IFF</i> is exchanged, is non&ndash;binding.</li>
    <li>The Creuss IFF may be played even if the Creuss player has not researched <i>Wormhole Generator</i>.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Dimensional Splicer <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Any wormhole may trigger <i>Dimensional Splicer</i>, including the <i>Hil Colish</i></li>
    <li>One hit will be produced even if the system contains multiple wormholes.</li>
    <li>The Creuss player chooses which ship the hit is assigned to.</li>
    <li>The <i>Shields Holding</i> action card may be used to cancel the hit.</li>
    <li>The chosen ship may cancel the hit by using its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability, if present. A different ship with the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability cannot do so.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If the chosen ship does so, the <i>Direct Hit</i> and/or <i>Reflective Shielding</i> action cards may be used.</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Wormhole Generator <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>This ability is mandatory for the Creuss player in every status phase after it has been researched.</li>
    <ol><li>The Creuss player may move a wormhole token from the system it is in into the same system.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Hil Colish <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the <i>Hil Colish</i> moves first, then the Creuss player uses the <i>Hil Colish</i>&rsquo;s new position when determining if the active system may be reached by their other ships.</li>
    <li>If the <i>Hil Colish</i> moves first, but is removed due to the effect of a gravity rift, then ships that move later cannot use its wormhole.</li>
    <li>If the <i>Hil Colish</i> moves last, then it may move itself into (or though, if its move value is increased) the Creuss Gate or Creuss home system. Before it does so, the Creuss player&rsquo;s other ships may move through the wormhole in the <i>Hil Colish</i>&rsquo;s system.</li>
    <li>If the <i>Hil Colish</i> moves before or after other ships, it does not generate a second <b>Space Cannon Offense</b> step.</li>
    <li>A unit with the <sc>Deep Space Cannon</sc> ability may produce hits in systems adjacent to that unit via the delta wormhole in the <i>Hil Colish</i>&rsquo;s system.</li>
    <li>If an effect allows another player to move through a system that contains the Creuss player&rsquo;s ships (such as the <i>Light/Wave Deflector</i> technology), that player may move through the delta wormhole in the <i>Hil Colish</i>&rsquo;s system.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Emissary Taivra <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Creuss player may use this ability to access the inactive wormhole nexus without a gamma wormhole. Moving ships into the wormhole nexus this way will cause it to flip.</li>
    <li>A delta wormhole in the system (such as from the <i>Hil Colish</i>) does not prevent this ability from being usable.</li>
    <li>If this ability is used, the active system will be adjacent to systems with delta wormholes.</li>
    <li>This ability does not cause the active system to contain a wormhole. <i>Dimensional Splicer</i> cannot be used in the system unless it already contained a wormhole.</li>
    <li>If a ship moves from the system containing the Ion Storm, it will not flip, unless the active player may move ships through the Ion Storm wormhole and chooses to do so.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Sai Seravus <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Creuss player cannot remove a ground force to create capacity for a fighter.</li>
    <li>This ability may be used whenever the Creuss player&rsquo;s ships move, not just during the movement step of a tactical action.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>While this ability may be used when the Creuss player retreats, retreating will leave no capacity in the active system.</li>
        <li>If the Mahact player uses their <i>Benediction</i> hero ability to move the Creuss player&rsquo;s ships, then the Creuss player may use this ability.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>A ship may move out of a system and back into the same system during tactical action movement, if its move value is high enough. If the Creuss player does this with a ship with capacity, and moves in this manner via a wormhole, they may place a fighter, if possible.</li>
    <li>When the Creuss player moves a ship through a wormhole and into a third system that contains an alpha or beta wormhole and unlocks their Sai Seravus, they cannot apply its ability to that movement.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Riftwalker Meian &mdash; Singularity Reactor <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Any units and tokens on either system are moved with their system.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Icarus Drive <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Icarus Drive does not have to be in the activated system.</li>
    <li>The wormhole token is placed in the system the Icarus Drive was in.</li>
    </ol>
