cards:
- name: Alliance
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: An Alliance must be played by the receiving player as soon as it is received.
        It cannot be kept secret.

        '1.1':
          rule: If the active player receives an Alliance, they cannot then attempt
            to trade it with another player. It must be played immediately.
    '2':
      rule: Alliance is returned when the system is activated, even if the active
        player will perform no hostile acts towards the other player this turn.
    '3':
      rule: If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places
        a command counter in a system with the other player’s units (for example,
        the primary ability of the Diplomacy strategy card), this will not cause Alliance
        to be returned.
    '4':
      rule: Activating a system containing only a player’s structures will still cause
        their Alliance to be returned.

        notes page.
- name: Ceasefire

        in which their Ceasefire is played, those units will remain in the active
        system.
    '3':
      rule: If the active player already has units with capacity in the active system,
        they may transport ground forces on planets in that system into the space
        area of that system. Those units may then be committed to invade a planet
        during this tactical action.
    '4':

        activated, that player may still play the active player’s Ceasefire.

          rule: If a player has had their Political Secret played, other players may
            still use that player’s other promissory notes.
    '2':
      rule: If an agenda is discarded, each Political Secret that has been played
        is returned. The affected players may vote on the next agenda as normal.

        if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the other player
        this turn.
    '3':
      rule: If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places
        a command counter in a system with the other player’s units (for example,
        the primary ability of the Diplomacy strategy card), this will not cause Support
        For The Throne to be returned.
    '4':
