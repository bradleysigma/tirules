  rules:
    '87.1':
      rule: For each Sustain Damage ability that a player uses, one hit produced by
        another player’s units is canceled. Then, each unit using this ability is
        placed on its side to indicate that it is damaged.
    '87.2':
      rule: A damaged unit does not have reduced capabilities and is functionally
        the same as an undamaged unit, except that it cannot use the Sustain Damage
        ability.
    '87.3':
      rule: A damaged unit cannot use the Sustain Damage ability until it is repaired
        during the status phase or by another game effect.
    '87.4':
      rule: A unit can use its Sustain Damage ability any time a hit is produced against
        it. This includes hits produced during combat and from unit abilities such
        as the Space Cannon ability.
      subrules:
        87.4.1:
          rule: A unit can only use the Sustain Damage ability if it is eligible to
            be hit. For example, a player cannot use a dreadnought’s Sustain Damage
            ability to cancel a hit from Anti–Fighter Barrage.
    '87.5':
      rule: The Sustain Damage ability cannot be used to cancel an effect that directly
        destroys a unit.
    '87.6':
      rule: The Barony of Letnev’s Non–Euclidean Shielding faction technology allows
        the Letnev player’s units with the Sustain Damage ability to cancel up to
        two hits instead of one.
