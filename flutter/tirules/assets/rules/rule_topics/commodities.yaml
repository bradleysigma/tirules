  rules:
    '21.1':
      rule: Commodities and trade goods are represented by opposite sides of the same
        token.
    '21.2':
      rule: The commodity value on a player’s faction sheet indicates the maximum
        number of commodities that player can have.
    '21.3':
      rule: When an effect instructs a player to replenish commodities, that player
        takes the number of commodity tokens necessary so that the amount of commodities
        that player has equals the commodity value on their faction sheet. Then, those
        tokens are placed faceup in the commodity area of that player’s faction sheet.
    '21.4':
      rule: When a player replenishes commodities, that player takes the commodity
        tokens from the supply.
    '21.5':
      rule: Players can trade commodities following the rules for transactions. When
        a player receives a commodity from another player, the player who received
        that token converts it into a trade good by placing it in the trade good area
        of their command sheet with the trade good side faceup.
      subrules:
        21.5.1:
          rule: That token is no longer a commodity token; it is a trade good token.
        21.5.2:
          rule: A player can trade commodity tokens before resolving a game effect
            that allows them to replenish commodities.
        21.5.3:
          rule: If a game effect instructs a player to convert a number of their own
            commodities to trade goods, those trade goods are not treated as being
            gained for the purpose of triggering other abilities.
    '21.6':
      rule: Any game effect that instructs a player to give a commodity to another
        player causes that commodity to be converted into a trade good.
    '21.7':
      rule: A player cannot spend commodities unless otherwise specified; a player
        can only trade them during a transaction.
    '21.8':
      rule: Commodity tokens come in values of one and three. A player can swap between
        these tokens as necessary.

  rules:
    '1':
      rule: A player starts the game with zero commodities.
    '2':
      rule: If a player has their maximum number of commodities, and is instructed

        will still trigger any “when [this] player replenishes commodities” effects,
        most notably the Trade Agreement promissory note.
