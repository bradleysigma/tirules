  rules:
    '32.1':
      rule: During the action phase, if the active player has the Diplomacy strategy
        card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that cardâ€™s primary ability.
    '32.2':
      rule: To resolve the primary ability on the Diplomacy strategy card, the active
        player chooses a system that contains a planet they control other than the
        Mecatol Rex system; each other player places one command token from their
        reinforcements in that system. Then, the active player readies any two of
        their exhausted planets.
      subrules:
        32.2.1:
          rule: If a player has no command tokens in their reinforcements, that player
            places one command token of their choice from their command sheet.
        32.2.2:
          rule: If a player already has a command token in the chosen system, they
            do not place a command token there.
    '32.3':
      rule: After the active player resolves the primary ability of the Diplomacy
        strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of
        the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from
        their strategy pool to ready up to two exhausted planets they control.
