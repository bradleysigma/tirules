        20.3.1:

            reinforcements, that player cannot gain that command token.
        20.3.2:
          rule: If a game effect would place a player’s command token from their reinforcements
            and none are available, that player must take a token from a pool on their
            command sheet, unless the token would be placed into a system that already
            contains one of their command tokens.
    '20.4':
      rule: During the action phase, a player can perform a tactical action by spending
        a command token from their tactic pool; they place the command token in a
        system.
    '20.5':
      rule: After a player performs a strategic action during the action phase, each
        other player can resolve the secondary ability of that strategy card by spending
        a command token from their strategy pool.
      subrules:
        20.5.1:
          rule: A player does not spend a command token to resolve the secondary ability
            of the Leadership strategy card.
    '20.6':
      rule: If a game effect would place a player’s command token in a system where
        they already have one, they place the token in their reinforcements instead.
        Any effects that resolve by placing that token are resolved as normal.
