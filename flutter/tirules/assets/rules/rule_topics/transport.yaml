  rules:
    '95.1':
      rule: The ship can pick up and transport fighters and ground forces when it
        moves. During a tactical action, it can pick up and transport units from the
        active system, the system it started its movement in, and each system it moves
        through.
      subrules:
        95.1.1:
          rule: These transported units remain with the transporting ship until it
            is finished moving.
        95.1.2:
          rule: Units being transported by a ship that is removed from the board by
            a gravity rift are also removed from the board.
    '95.2':
      rule: Any fighters and ground forces that a ship transports must move with the
        ship and remain in the space area of a system.
    '95.3':
      rule: Fighters and ground forces cannot be picked up from a system that contains
        one of their faction’s command tokens other than the active system.
    '95.4':
      rule: A player can land ground forces on a planet in a system during the Invasion
        step of a tactical action.
- name: Notes
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: A ship that can both move and be transported (i.e. Fighter II) cannot
        do both by “meeting” a ship with capacity partway through a tactical action
        movement, as all movement is simultaneous.
    '2':
      rule: A ship may transport as it retreats or is otherwise moved out of the active
        system, as the units it transports will be picked up from the active system.
    '3':
      rule: A ship may pick up ground forces from a planet in the active system, usually
        to invade a different planet in the same system.
    '4':
      rule: A ship cannot pick up more units from a planet than it has capacity. However,
        a ship may pick up any units (including none) in a system as it transports,
        even if doing so would cause units to be removed due to capacity limits.
      subrules:
        '4.1':
          rule: 'For example, say a carrier (with capacity 4) is in the space area
            of a system along with four fighters. On the only planet in that system
            are eight infantry. There are no other units in the system. When the carrier
            moves out of the system, it obeys the following:'
        '4.2':
          rule: The carrier may transport the four fighters, leaving behind all eight
            of the infantry in the system.
        '4.3':
          rule: The carrier may transport four of the eight infantry, leaving behind
            the four remaining infantry in the system. Now that the system has zero
            capacity, all four of the fighters will be removed.
        '4.4':
          rule: The carrier may transport two of the eight infantry and two of the
            four fighters, leaving behind the six remaining infantry in the system.
            Now that the system has zero capacity, the two remaining fighters will
            be removed.
        '4.5':
          rule: The carrier may transport nothing, leaving behind all eight of the
            infantry in the system. Now that the system has zero capacity, all four
            of the fighters will be removed.
        '4.6':
          rule: The carrier cannot attempt to pick up all eight infantry, even if
            it immediately removes four of them (and the fighters).
    '5':
      rule: A future rule change will allow a player’s ships to transport units from
        systems that contain that player’s command token when those ships move outside
        of a tactical action.
