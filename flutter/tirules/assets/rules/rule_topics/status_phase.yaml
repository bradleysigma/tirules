        score up to one public objective and one secret objective that can be fulfilled
        during the status phase. To score an objective, a player must fulfill the
        requirements on the card; if that player does, they gain a number of victory
        points indicated on the card.'

      rule: 'Step 5 – Gain and Redistribute Command Tokens: Each player gains two
        command tokens. A player takes each gained token from their reinforcements.

        to the common play area. Then, if a player has removed the custodians token

        a new game round begins with the strategy phase.'

  rules:
    '1':
      rule: A player cannot score public objectives if that player does not control
        each planet in their home system.
    '2':
      rule: If there are few cards remaining in the action card deck, they will be
        dealt out first to the players lowest in initiative order. After those players
        have discarded down to their seven card hand limit, if necessary, the discard
        pile will be shuffled to form a new deck. The remaining players (including
        the player who received the last action card from the previous deck, if applicable)
        will then be dealt their action cards.
    '3':
      rule: All damaged units will be repaired, even if a game effect has caused those
        units to no longer have the Sustain Damage ability.
