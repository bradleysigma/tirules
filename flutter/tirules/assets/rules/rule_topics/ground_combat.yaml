  rules:
    '42.1':
      rule: 'Step 1 – Roll Dice: Each player rolls one die for each ground force they
        have on the planet; this is a combat roll. If a unit’s combat roll produces
        a result that is equal to or greater than that unit’s combat value, that roll
        produces a hit.'
      subrules:
        42.1.1:
          rule: If a unit’s combat value contains two or more burst icons, the player
            rolls one die for each burst icon instead.
    '42.2':
      rule: 'Step 2 – Assign Hits: Each player in the combat must choose one of their
        own ground forces on the planet to be destroyed for each hit result their
        opponent produced.'
      subrules:
        42.2.1:
          rule: When a unit is destroyed, the player who controls that unit removes
            it from the board and places it in their reinforcements.
    '42.3':
      rule: After assigning hits, if both players still have ground forces on the
        planet, players resolve a new combat round starting with the Roll Dice step.
    '42.4':
      rule: Ground combat ends when only one player (or neither player) has ground
        forces on the planet.
      subrules:
        42.4.1:
          rule: During the first round of a combat, “start of combat” and “start of
            combat round” effects occur during the same timing window.
        42.4.2:
          rule: During the last round of a combat, “end of combat” and “end of combat
            round” effects occur during the same timing window.
        42.4.3:
          rule: After a combat ends, the player with one or more ground forces remaining
            on the planet is the winner of the combat; the other player is the loser
            of the combat.
        42.4.4:
          rule: If neither player has a ground force remaining, there is no winner;
            the combat ends in a draw.

        fought in.
