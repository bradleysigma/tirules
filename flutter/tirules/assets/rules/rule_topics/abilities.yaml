- name: Rules Reference
  rules:
    '1.1':
      rule: If information in this Rules Reference contradicts the Learn to Play booklet,
        the Rules Reference takes precedence.
    '1.10':
      rule: Some abilities have a cost that is followed by an effect. The cost of
        an ability is separated from the effect by the word “to” or by a semicolon.
        A player cannot resolve the effect of such an ability if they cannot resolve
        that ability’s cost.
    '1.11':
      rule: Some examples of an ability’s cost include spending resources, spending
        trade goods, spending command tokens, exhausting cards, purging cards, and
        activating specific systems.
    '1.12':
      rule: If the timing of an ability uses the word “before” or “after”, the ability’s
        effect occurs immediately before or after the described timing event, respectively.
      subrules:
        1.12.1:
          rule: For example, if an ability is resolved “after a ship is destroyed”,
            the ability must be resolved as soon as the ship is destroyed and not
            later during that turn or round.
    '1.13':
      rule: If the timing of an ability uses the word “when”, the ability’s effect
        occurs at the moment of the described timing event.
      subrules:
        1.13.1:
          rule: Such an ability typically modifies or replaces the timing event in
            some way.
    '1.14':
      rule: Effects that occur “when” an event happens take priority over effects
        that occur “after” an event happens.
    '1.15':
      rule: If an ability uses the word “then”, a player must resolve the effect that
        occurs before the word “then” or they cannot resolve the effect that occurs
        after the word “then”.
    '1.16':
      rule: Each ability can be resolved once for each occurrence of that ability’s
        timing event. For example, if an ability is resolved “at the start of combat”,
        it can be resolved at the start of each combat.
    '1.17':
      rule: If there are multiple abilities that players wish to resolve at the same
        time during the action phase, each player takes a turn resolving an ability
        in initiative order, beginning with the active player. This process continues
        until each player has resolved each ability that they wish to resolve during
        that window.
    '1.18':
      rule: If there are multiple abilities that players wish to resolve at the same
        time during the strategy or agenda phases, players take turns resolving abilities
        starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise. This process continues
        until each player has resolved each ability that they wish to resolve during
        that window.
    '1.19':
      rule: The opening paragraph of each ability found on an action card describes
        when a player can resolve that card’s ability.
    '1.2':
      rule: If a card ability contradicts information in the Rules Reference, the
        card takes precedence. If both the card and the rules can be followed at the
        same time, they should be.
    '1.20':
      rule: The opening paragraph of most abilities found on promissory notes describes
        when a player can resolve that card’s ability.
      subrules:
        1.20.1:
          rule: Some promissory notes have abilities that trigger as soon as a player
            receives the card.
    '1.21':
      rule: Abilities on agenda cards correspond to an outcome. Players resolve these
        abilities during the agenda phase after players vote for a particular outcome.
    '1.22':
      rule: Each faction has faction abilities presented on its faction sheet. Each
        faction’s flagship has one or more unique abilities. Some abilities provide
        players with perpetual effects.
    '1.23':
      rule: 'Some units have unit abilities. These abilities are named and presented
        above a unit’s attributes on a player’s faction sheet or on a unit upgrade
        card. Each unit ability has unique rules for when a player can resolve that
        ability. The following abilities are unit abilities:'
    '1.24':
      rule: If a unit’s ability uses the phrase “this system” or “this planet”, the
        ability is referring to the system or planet that contains that unit.
    '1.3':
      rule: Each ability describes when and how a player can resolve it.
      subrules:
        1.3.1:
          rule: If an ability with a specified duration is resolved, the effect of
            the ability remains through that duration, even if the component that
            caused the ability is removed.
    '1.4':
      rule: If a card has multiple abilities, each ability is presented as its own
        paragraph.
    '1.5':
      rule: If an ability contains the word “Action” a player must use a component
        action during the action phase to resolve that ability.
    '1.6':
      rule: If an ability uses the word “cannot”, that effect is absolute.
      subrules:
        1.6.1:
          rule: If two abilities use the word “cannot”, a persistent ability takes
            precedence over a one–time ability and an enabling ability takes precedence
            over a cancel ability.
    '1.7':
      rule: When a player resolves an ability, they must resolve the ability in its
        entirety. Any parts of the ability preceded by the word “may” are optional,
        and the player resolving the ability may choose not to resolve those parts.
    '1.8':
      rule: Abilities on components that remain in play are mandatory unless those
        abilities use the word “may”.
    '1.9':
      rule: If an ability has multiple effects separated by the word “and”, a player
        must resolve as many of the ability’s effects as possible. However, if the
        player cannot resolve all of its effects, that player is allowed to resolve
        as many as they can.
- name: Notes
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: An ability may be triggered during the timing window it was gained, if
        applicable. For example, if a player receives the Creuss player’s Creuss Iff
        promissory note at the start of their turn, they may use it immediately.
      subrules:
        '1.1':
          rule: Note that some triggers check their conditions when they trigger,
            while some check their conditions when they would resolve.
        '1.2':
          rule: The Ul player’s Awaken ability is an example of an ability that checks
            its condition when it triggers; activating a system without a sleeper
            token will not trigger Awaken, even if a sleeper token is later added
            during the activation step of that tactical action.
        '1.3':
          rule: The Assault Cannon technology is an example of an ability that checks
            its condition when it would resolve; a player without three or more non–fighter
            ships in the system cannot use Assault Cannon, even if they previously
            had more ships.
    '2':
      rule: An ability from a single physical object cannot be resolved more than
        once in one timing window. For example, if a player starts their turn with
        the Creuss player’s Creuss Iff promissory note in their hand (having received
        it on a previous turn) and uses it, they will not be able to use it a second
        time this turn, if they receive it again as part of a transaction.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: Each unit on the board is its own separate physical object. For example,
            two or more of the N’orr player’s Exotrireme II in a system may use their
            ability to destroy themselves and other ships, as the ability is linked
            to the units on the game board, and not the unit upgrade technology card.
    '3':
      rule: Multiple action cards with the same name cannot be played during a single
        timing window to affect the same units or game effect. See the action cards
        page for more details.
    '4':
      rule: During the action phase, abilities are resolved in the current relative
        turn order, starting with the active player. For example, if it is currently
        the Trade (5) player’s turn, they will have the option to resolve first, then
        the Warfare (6) player, then the Technology (7) player, and so on.
      subrules:
        '4.1':
          rule: If a player has multiple abilities they wish to resolve, they must
            be resolved one at a time. Between each ability being resolved, each other
            player will have the opportunity to resolve one ability.
        '4.2':
          rule: 'For example, Alice, the active player, wishes to resolve four abilities
            during the current timing window. Bob, the next player in order, wishes
            to resolve one. Cheng, later in the order, wishes to resolve two. The
            order of resolution would be: Alice #1; Bob #1; Cheng #1; Alice #2; Cheng
            #2; Alice #3; Alice #4.'
        '4.3':
          rule: Once every player has consecutively declined to resolve an ability
            during a timing window, no more abilities may be resolved during that
            window.
        '4.4':
          rule: A player may decline to resolve an ability during a timing window,
            but later choose to resolve an ability during that same timing window,
            but only if another player chooses to resolve an ability after the player
            declined.
        '4.5':
          rule: 'Following on from the above example, had Alice declined to resolve
            “Alice #2”, she could still resolve “Alice #3”, as Cheng resolved “Cheng
            #2”, breaking the series of consecutive declinations. However, if Alice
            had instead declined to resolve “Alice #3”, she would be unable to resolve
            “Alice #4”, as then each player would have consecutively declined to resolve
            an ability.'
    '5':
      rule: The secondary abilities of strategy cards are resolved in clockwise order,
        after the primary ability.
    '6':
      rule: A player may resolve “at the start of your turn” and “at the end of your
        turn” abilities on the turn that they pass.
    '7':
      rule: All abilities that occur “when” an event occurs all trigger before any
        abilities that occur “after” the same event occurs.
    '8':
      rule: All abilities that occur “after” an event occurs all trigger before any
        abilities that occur “before” the next event occurs.
