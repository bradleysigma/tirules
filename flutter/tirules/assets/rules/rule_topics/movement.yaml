  rules:
    '58.1':
      rule: A ship’s move value is presented along with its other attributes on faction
        sheets and unit upgrade technology cards. This value indicates the distance
        from its current system that a ship can move.
    '58.2':
      rule: 'Step 1 – Move Ships: A player can move any number of their eligible ships
        into the active system, obeying the following rules:'
      subrules:
        58.2.1:
          rule: The ship must end its movement in the active system.
        58.2.2:
          rule: The ship cannot move through a system that contains ships that are
            controlled by another player.
        58.2.3:
          rule: The ship cannot move if it started its movement in another system
            that contains one of its faction’s command tokens.
        58.2.4:
          rule: The ship can move through systems that contain its own faction’s command
            tokens.
        58.2.5:
          rule: The ship can move out of the active system and back into it if its
            move value is high enough.
        58.2.6:
          rule: The ship must move along a path of adjacent systems, and the number
            of systems the ship enters cannot exceed its move value.
    '58.3':
      rule: When a ship with a capacity value moves or is moved, it may transport
        ground forces and fighters.
    '58.4':
      rule: The active player declares which of their ships are moving before any
        ships move. Those ships arrive in the active system simultaneously.
    '58.5':
      rule: 'Step 2 – Space Cannon Offense: After the Move Ships step, players can
        use the Space Cannon abilities of their units in the active system.'
    '58.6':
      rule: If an ability moves a unit outside of the Movement step of a tactical
        action, players follow the rules specified by that ability; neither a unit’s
        move value nor the rules specified above apply.
- name: Notes
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: When an effect moves a unit to an adjacent system, modifying that unit’s
        move value will have no effect.
    '2':
      rule: An ability may move a player’s ship out of a system containing one of
        the player’s faction’s commend tokens. However, the transport rules prevent
        a player’s units from being transported from systems containing one of that
        player’s command tokens, other than the active system. An ability that moves
        a player’s ship must also explicitly allow it to transport units from non–active
        systems containing that player’s faction’s command token for it to be able
        to do so.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: During a retreat, units may be transported from the active system.
    '3':
      rule: A ship that can both move and be transported (i.e. Fighter II) cannot
        do both by “meeting” a ship with capacity partway through a tactical action
        movement, as all movement is simultaneous.
    '4':
      rule: Ships only move “into” the destination system. A ship may move “through”
        other systems.
    '5':
      rule: Fighters alone will block other player’s ships from moving through that
        system, whether they are accompanied by a Space Dock or they are Fighters
        II.
