  rules:
    '97.1':
      rule: Unit upgrades share a name with a unit that is printed on a player’s faction
        sheet, but have a higher roman numeral. For example, a player’s “Carrier I”
        unit is upgraded by the unit upgrade technology “Carrier II”.
      subrules:
        97.1.1:
          rule: The Nekro Virus player may upgrade their units with units of the same
            type (e.g., “dreadnought” or “infantry”) even if those unit’s names do
            not match. If the Nekro Virus gains a unit upgrade technology of the same
            unit type as a unit upgrade technology they already have, the previous
            upgrade is removed, and they must use the same Valefar Assimilator token
            that was used to copy the previous upgrade.
    '97.2':
      rule: Players place unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets,
        covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.
    '97.3':
      rule: The white arrows next to an attribute on a faction sheet indicate that
        the attribute will improve when the unit is upgraded.
    '97.4':
      rule: After a player gains a unit upgrade card, each of that player’s units
        that correspond to that upgrade card is treated as having the attributes and
        abilities printed on that upgrade card. Any previous attributes of that unit,
        such as the one printed on that player’s faction sheet, are ignored.
    '97.5':
      rule: A mech unit card is not a technology.
