        card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that cardâ€™s primary ability.

      rule: To resolve the primary ability on the Construction strategy card, the
        active player may place either one PDS or one space dock on a planet they

      rule: After the active player resolves the primary ability of the Construction
        strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of
        the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from
        their strategy pool and place that command token in any system. If that player
        already has a command token in that system, the spent token is returned to

        space dock on a planet they control in that system.

            can remove a unit from any system that does not contain one of their command
            tokens and place that unit in their reinforcements. Then, that player
            must place the unit on the game board as instructed by the effect that
