    '46.3':
      rule: If a player ever has an infantry token on a planet that does not contain
        one of their plastic infantry or in the space area of a system that does not
        contain one of their plastic infantry, that player must replace it with one
        of their plastic infantry from their reinforcements.

- name: Notes
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: As each player only has twelve plastic infantry figures, a player cannot
        have infantry on more than twelve planets or being transported in more than
        twelve space areas, or any combination thereof.
    '2':
      rule: Players may also swap infantry tokens for plastic pieces at any time.
    '3':
      rule: Infantry tokens are not component limited.
    '4':
      rule: A player may remove a plastic infantry figure from a planet or space area,
        along with any accompanying infantry tokens, if doing so allows them to swap
        it into the active system and allows them to commit ground forces to and fight
        ground combats on multiple planets during the Invasion step of the tactical
        action in that system when they could otherwise not do so.
    '5':
      rule: A future rule change will have any unaccompanied infantry tokens removed,
        instead of destroyed.
