- name: Acquiescence (Promissory Note)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: If either strategy card had trade goods on it at the start of the strategy
        phase, those trade goods remain with the player that originally chose the

            Gate Folding.
        '2.2':

            in systems containing alpha or beta wormholes during the Space Cannon

            active system.
        '2.3':
          rule: Units in the Mecatol Rex system with the Deep Space Cannon ability
            may use it during the Space Cannon Offense step of the Winnu player’s
            turn if the active system contains an alpha or beta wormhole.
        '2.4':
          rule: A player may retreat to a system containing an alpha or beta wormhole
            from the Mecatol Rex system, or vice versa, during the Winnu player’s

        will be no additional effect.
- name: Salai Sai Corian (Flagship)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: If the Winnu player’s opponent has only fighters participating in the

      rule: If a system meets two (or more) of the conditions listed (such as by attaching
        the Nano–Forge relic to Mecatol Rex), Rickar Rickani will only apply +2 to
        combat rolls, not +4 (or +6).
- name: Mathis Mathinus — Imperial Seal (Hero)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: A player chosen to perform the secondary ability must still spend a command
        token from their strategy pool to do so, except for the Leadership strategy
        card and potentially the Trade strategy card.
      subrules:
        '1.1':
          rule: In the case of the Construction strategy card, the command token is
            placed as required on the game board.
    '2':
      rule: If the Winnu player chooses the Trade strategy card for this ability and
        the Winnu player chooses a player to resolve the secondary without spending
        a command token via the primary ability, the chosen player must resolve the
        secondary ability. Additionally, if the Winnu player chooses a player to resolve
        the secondary via the Hero’s ability, it is optional for that player to resolve
        the secondary, but if they do, they must spend a strategy token to do so.

      rule: Acquiescence Ω cannot be triggered by this ability.
- name: Reclaimer (Mech)
  rules:
    '1':

        player places a Space Dock, they cannot produce out of it during the same
        action.
    '2':
      rule: If the Winnu player has no PDS or Space Docks left in their reinforcements,
        they may remove a unit from any system that does not contain one of their
        command tokens and place that unit on the newly controlled planet.
    '3':
      rule: If the Winnu player gains control of a planet with multiple Reclaimers,
        they may place a structure for each one, if they may do so without exceeding
        the maximum number of that structure allowed on a planet.
    '4':
      rule: The Reclaimer need only be on the planet at the end of the tactical action
        the Winnu player gained it, not when the Winnu player gains control of it.
        This can occur from effects such as the Infiltrate action card, or some exploration
        cards.
