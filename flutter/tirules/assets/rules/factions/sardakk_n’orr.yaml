        produced in the immediately preceding Roll Dice step.
      subrules:
        '1.1':
          rule: Valkyrie Particle Weave produces a hit before any hits may be cancelled.
            Cancelling the original hits will not cause the additional hit to be cancelled.

        used to prevent ships from being destroyed.
    '3':

        of an Exotrireme II to destroy an opponent’s ship.

  rules:
    '1':
      rule: Planets in the home system of an eliminated player will not contribute
        to unlocking G’hom Sek’kus.
    '10':
      rule: If the N’orr player purges the Dominus Orb relic during the Movement step
        of a tactical action, they may use G’hom Sek’kus to commit ground forces from
        systems that contain their command tokens during that tactical action.
    '11':
      rule: The Commit Ground Forces step is entirely resolved before the Establish
        Control step (with other steps between). When the N’orr player gains control

        then use G’hom Sek’kus to commit additional ground forces during that tactical
        action.

        even if they have no ships in the active system.
    '3':
      rule: The Parley action card will place the committed ground forces in the space
        area of the active system. If the N’orr player does not have enough capacity
        in the space area for the extra ground forces, including zero capacity, they
        will have to remove fighters and ground forces to meet capacity limits.
    '4':
      rule: The N’orr player may commit up to one ground force from each eligible
        planet during each Commit Ground Forces step, regardless of the number of
        planets they are committing ground forces to.
    '5':
      rule: The N’orr player may only commit ground forces as the active player.
    '6':
      rule: Only the active player may use the Bombardment ability of their units
        during an invasion. As such, any ships in the active system will be unable

        '6.1':
          rule: This prevents the L1Z1X player from using their Harrow faction ability,

      rule: Another player may still produce hits against the N’orr player’s ground
        forces committed using G’hom Sek’kus during the Space Cannon Defense step.
    '8':
      rule: The N’orr player must legally be able to move into the destination system
        in order to commit ground forces with G’hom Sek’kus
      subrules:
        '8.1':
          rule: If another player plays the N’orr player’s Ceasefire promissory note,
            they cannot commit any ground forces to planets in the active system during
            this action, other than ground forces already in the active system.
        '8.2':
          rule: The N’orr player cannot commit ground forces to Mirage if it is in
            an asteroid field, unless the N’orr player owns the Antimass Deflectors
            technology.
        '8.3':
          rule: The N’orr player cannot commit ground forces to Mirage if it is in
            a supernova. Another player may do so if they own the Magmus Reactor Muaat
            faction technology and the N’orr player’s Alliance promissory note.
        '8.4':
          rule: If the N’orr player commits any ground forces from a gravity rift

            the Enforced Travel Ban law is in play.
    '9':
      rule: The N’orr player may use this ability to commit ground forces to any planet
        in the active system, regardless of who, if anyone, controls it.
- name: Sh’val, Harbinger — Tekklar Conditioning (Hero)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The Parley action card will place the committed ground forces in the space
        area of the active system. As the N’orr player will not have enough capacity
        in the space area for their ground forces, they will have to remove all ground
        forces from that planet, that are now in the space area of that system.
    '2':
      rule: The Space Cannon Offense, Space Combat and Bombardment steps are skipped.
    '3':
      rule: Another player may still produce hits against the N’orr player’s ground
        forces committed using Tekklar Conditioning during the Space Cannon Defense
        step.
    '4':
      rule: Any abilities that trigger “after a player moves ships…” or similar cannot
        be used following Tekklar Conditioning.
- name: Valkyrie Exoskeleton (Mech)

    '1':
      rule: The hit produced by the Valkyrie Exoskeleton is added to any other hits
        produced in the immediately preceding Roll Dice step.

        combat, it mandatorily produces a hit.
