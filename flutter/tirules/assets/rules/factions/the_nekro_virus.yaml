cards:
- name: Galactic Threat
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The Nekro player may still play rider action cards.
    '2':
      rule: If the Nekro player has the Xxcha player’s Alliance promissory note, the
        Nekro player may vote, without losing their ability to predict outcomes for
        their Galactic Threat ability.
    '3':
      rule: If the speaker breaks a tie without casting any votes, then the speaker’s
        technology are ineligible to be gained.
      subrules:
        '3.1':
          rule: If no player casts votes, then no technology can be gained.
- name: Technology Singularity
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: If the Nekro player gains a technology during a space combat, this does
        not prevent them from gaining technology during ground combats in the Invasion
        step of the same tactical action.
    '2':
      rule: If multiple ground combats happen on separate planets as part of a single
        Invasion step during one action, the Nekro player may gain a technology during
        each combat.
    '3':
      rule: Any method that destroys a unit during combat will trigger Technology
        Singularity, including an anti–fighter barrage roll, the Direct Hit action
        card, the Creuss player’s Dimensional Splicer faction technology, etc.
      subrules:
        '3.1':
          rule: This includes any method used by the Nekro player’s opponent that
            destroys their own units, usually as an ability cost.
        '3.2':
          rule: If a unit is removed, but not destroyed, that unit will not trigger
            the Technology Singularity ability.
        '3.3':
          rule: Space cannon and bombardment rolls happen outside of combat. Any hits
            produced cannot be used to trigger the Technology Singularity ability.
    '4':
      rule: If the Nekro player chooses to gain a unit upgrade technology, that upgrade
        will be in effect from that point in the combat onwards.
      subrules:
        '4.1':
          rule: The combat value of a combat dice is fixed as it is rolled, and all
            combat dice are rolled before any hits are assigned. Gaining a unit upgrade
            technology will not cause any already rolled combat dice to produce any
            additional hits due to an improved combat value. The same applies to unit
            ability dice.
        '4.2':
          rule: Destroying an opponent’s unit during the Anti–Fighter Barrage step,
            and gaining a unit upgrade technology will allow units of that type to
            use the abilities and attributes of the upgrade for the combat rolls of
            the same round.
        '4.3':
          rule: Destroying an opponent’s unit at the start of a combat, such as with
            the ability of the Assault Cannon technology, and gaining a unit upgrade
            technology with an Anti–Fighter Barrage ability will allow units of that
            type to use that ability during the Anti–Fighter Barrage step of the first
            round of combat.
        '4.4':
          rule: If the Nekro player uses the Direct Hit action card to destroy a unit
            when it uses its Sustain Damage ability, this will occur before any units
            are destroyed from being assigned hits. If the Nekro player then gains
            a technology that gives their units the Sustain Damage ability, they may
            then use that ability for their units participating in the combat to cancel
            hits produced by their opponent during that round of combat.
        '4.5':
          rule: Players resolve abilities in initiative order, starting from the active
            player, until all players decline to resolve an ability consecutively;
            players who declined to resolve an ability previously may choose to resolve
            an ability if another player does so. While every player has the opportunity
            to resolve an ability, it is most common for only the two players involved
            in the combat to do so. Say the Nekro player does not have the Dreadnought
            II unit upgrade. If they use the Sustain Damage ability of one of their
            dreadnoughts, then their opponent may destroy it with a Direct Hit action
            card. If the Nekro player does not use the Sustain Damage ability (or
            any other ability within the same timing window), then their opponent
            may choose to use the Sustain Damage ability of one of their units (or
            any other ability within the same timing window). If they do not, then
            the timing window advances, and no more units may use their Sustain Damage
            abilities to cancel any of the remaining hits. If the opponent does, however,
            use the Sustain Damage ability of one of their units, the Nekro player
            may then destroy it with a Direct Hit action card, if it is an eligible
            target. After that, the Nekro player may choose to use the Sustain Damage
            ability of one of their units, even if they had previously declined to
            do so; if they gained the Dreadnought II unit upgrade when they destroyed
            their opponent’s non-dreadnought unit with the Direct Hit action card,
            then their opponent can no longer destroy the Nekro player’s with their
            own Direct Hit action card.
    '5':
      rule: If the Nekro player destroys a unit, and gains a technology with an ability
        that is used during the same timing window, they may use that ability immediately.
      subrules:
        '5.1':
          rule: For example, if the Nekro player uses the ability of the Assault Cannon
            technology at the start of a space combat to destroy a unit belonging
            to the Creuss player, and thus place a Valefar token on that player’s
            Dimensional Splicer faction technology, the Nekro player may immediately
            use the ability of their Valefar Dimensional Splicer to produce a hit
            against one of the Creuss player’s ships.
    '6':
      rule: If the Nekro player gains the Infantry II unit upgrade from their Technology
        Singularity ability during a combat, any of the Nekro player’s infantry destroyed
        at the same time as the unit used to trigger the Technology Singularity ability
        will be returned to their reinforcements.
      subrules:
        '6.1':
          rule: If the Nekro player uses a Direct Hit action card to destroy an opponent’s
            unit, and gain the Infantry II unit upgrade, then any infantry destroyed
            in that Assign Hits step will roll to be placed on the Infantry II card.
            This will most commonly occur if the Nekro player has infantry participating
            in space combat via the ability of their flagship, The Alastor.
        '6.2':
          rule: Any infantry destroyed by the Argent player’s Strike Wing Alpha II
            faction unit ability are destroyed during the Roll Dice substep of the
            Anti–Fighter Barrage step. The Nekro player will not have the opportunity
            to gain the Infantry II unit upgrade until the Assign Hits substep immediately
            following, and so the destroyed infantry will be returned to their reinforcements.
- name: Propagation
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: If the Nekro player resolves an ability that instructs them to “gain”
        a technology, instead of “research” that technology, they will get that technology
        instead of the command tokens.
    '2':
      rule: The Nekro player may still resolve the primary or secondary abilities
        of the Technology strategy card, which will instead gain them command tokens.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: The Nekro player may still benefit from owning the Minister of Sciences
            agenda card.
    '3':
      rule: If an ability triggers “when” a player researches a technology, that ability
        will still be triggered by the Nekro player.
      subrules:
        '3.1':
          rule: If the Nekro player owns The Prophet’s Tears relic, they may draw
            an action card whenever they would research a technology.
    '4':
      rule: If an ability triggers “after” a player researches a technology, that
        ability will never be triggered by the Nekro player.
      subrules:
        '4.1':
          rule: If the Anti–Intellectual Revolution law is in play, the Nekro player
            will not destroy a ship when they would research a technology.
    '5':
      rule: The Nekro player may play any action card that would allow them to research
        a technology, even if there is no viable technology that the Nekro player
        could have researched.
      subrules:
        '5.1':
          rule: For example, the Nekro player may always play the Reveal Prototype
            action card at the start of combat, even if they would not meet the prerequisites
            of any of the unit upgrades for the units they have participating in the
            combat, and/or they already have the unit upgrades for each unit they
            have participating in the combat, and/or the units they have participating
            in the combat have no unit upgrade.
- name: Antivirus (Promissory Note)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The effect of Antivirus does not prevent the Nekro player gaining a technology
        from a player via their Galactic Threat ability.
    '2':
      rule: The player holding Antivirus may only play it at the start of a combat
        they are participating in.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: Antivirus may be played at the start of a combat that the Nekro player
            is not participating in.
    '3':
      rule: Antivirus has no effect while it is in a player’s hand.
    '4':
      rule: Antivirus is returned when the system is activated, even if the active
        player will perform no hostile acts towards the Nekro player this turn.
    '5':
      rule: Activating a system containing only the Nekro player’s structures will
        still cause Antivirus to be returned.
    '6':
      rule: If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places
        a command counter in a system with the Nekro player’s units (for example,
        the primary ability of the Diplomacy strategy card), this will not cause Antivirus
        to be returned.
- name: Valefar Assimilator (Technology)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: When copying another technology, each Valefar Assimilator retains its
        original text; it may later be used to copy a different faction technology.
    '10':
      rule: 'If the Nekro player has copied certain technology (possibly two or more
        at different points in time), the following apply:'
      subrules:
        '10.1':
          rule: If both the Saar player’s Floating Factory II and the Vuil’raith player’s
            Vortex are copied, and another player blockades a Nekro space dock, the
            Nekro player returns any captured units, then destroys the blockaded space
            dock.
        '10.2':
          rule: If both the Letnev player’s Non–Euclidean Shielding and the generic
            Duranium Armor technologies are copied, then a space combat between the
            Nekro player and the Letnev player in certain circumstances may result
            in neither player being able to win. If this happens, the attacker must
            declare a retreat. If the attacker cannot do so, they destroy all their
            units in that combat.
        '10.3':
          rule: If both the Muaat player’s Magmus Reactor and the Saar player’s Floating
            Factory II are copied, the Nekro player may move their space docks into
            supernovae.
        '10.4':
          rule: If the Saar player’s Floating Factory II is copied, both the Nekro
            player and the Saar player may have their space docks in the same system,
            if there are no ships in that system.
        '10.5':
          rule: 'If the N’orr player’s Exotrireme II is copied, and the Nekro player
            is in a combat with the N’orr player, then the players will alternate
            when resolving end of combat round abilities, starting with the active
            player (all players may resolve abilities in initiative order, but it
            is most common for only the two players involved in the combat to want
            to resolve abilities). For example, if the attacking player has two Exotriremes
            II in the system and the defender has four, assuming both players are
            hostile towards each other, the most likely sequence is as follows: The
            attacker activates one of their Exotriremes II, leaving them with one
            and the defender with two; The defender activates one of their Exotriremes
            II leaving them with one and the attacker with none.'
    '11':
      rule: 'The Nekro player may lose a technology if they copy a new one. If they
        lose certain technologies, the following apply:'
      subrules:
        '11.1':
          rule: If the Saar player’s Floating Factory II is lost, each space dock
            the Nekro player controls must be placed on a planet they control in the
            same system, or the space dock is removed.
        '11.2':
          rule: If the Muaat player’s Prototype War Sun II is lost, and the Nekro
            player does not have the generic war sun technology, each of their war
            suns are removed from the game board.
        '11.3':
          rule: If the Muaat player’s Magmus Reactor is lost, the Nekro player’s units
            may remain in and move out of any supernovae they are currently in, but
            cannot move additional units into or through.
        '11.4':
          rule: If the Vuil’raith player’s Dimensional Tear II is lost, the dimensional
            tear tokens are removed from under the Nekro player’s space docks; the
            systems are no longer gravity rifts (unless the system tile is a printed
            gravity rift).
        '11.5':
          rule: If a unit upgrade that provides that unit with the Sustain Damage
            ability is lost, any damaged units will remain damaged, until either the
            status phase or another effect repairs them.
    '2':
      rule: When copying another technology, Valefar Assimilator will retain its exhausted/readied
        state. It will not copy the target technology’s exhausted/readied state.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: The Nekro player may use any ability of the copied technology that
            does not require exhausting as a cost, even if the Valefar Assimilator
            card is exhausted.
        '2.2':
          rule: An exhausted Valefar Assimilator will always ready during the Status
            Phase, even if it is not currently copying a technology with an exhaust
            ability.
    '3':
      rule: If the Nekro player would copy a faction–specific unit upgrade, and they
        are already copying a faction–specific unit upgrade of the same type, they
        must use the same Valefar Assimilator token; they lose the previous faction
        unit upgrade.
    '4':
      rule: The Nekro player cannot copy faction–specific units that have not been
        upgraded.
    '5':
      rule: A faction’s mech is not a technology. The Nekro player cannot use a Valefar
        Assimilator to copy a mech.
    '6':
      rule: If the Nekro player has a generic unit upgrade, and gains a faction–specific
        unit upgrade, then the faction–specific version will be in effect. If the
        faction–specific unit upgrade is later lost, they revert to the generic unit
        upgrade.
      subrules:
        '6.1':
          rule: Owning two unit upgrades for the same type of unit in this manner
            only counts as one unit upgrade towards the Develop Weaponry and Revolutionize
            Warfare objectives.
    '7':
      rule: If another player returns a technology which is currently being copied
        by a Valefar Assimilator, it will remain copied with a Valefar Assimilator
        token on it while in that player’s technology deck.
    '8':
      rule: For the Adapt New Strategies objective, a Valefar Assimilator technology
        will count if and only if it is currently copying another technology.
    '9':
      rule: For notes about technologies of a specific faction, see that faction’s
        notes.
- name: The Alastor (Flagship)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: Any effect that may target ships or non–fighter ships may target a ground
        force that is participating in space combat due to the effect of The Alastor.
      subrules:
        '1.1':
          rule: This includes counting towards the three non–fighter ships necessary
            to trigger the effect of the Assault Cannon technology.
        '1.2':
          rule: The Winnu player’s flagship, the Salai Sai Corian, will roll one dice
            for each ground force the Nekro player has participating in a space combat
            via the effect of The Alastor.
    '10':
      rule: A ground force participating in a space combat may count towards scoring
        the Demonstrate Your Power secret objective.
    '11':
      rule: If the Nekro player loses their last ground force during a space combat
        and consequently meets the requirements for elimination, they are immediately
        eliminated. They will not be given the opportunity to score any objectives
        from winning the combat or destroying certain units at the same time their
        last ground force was destroyed.
      subrules:
        '11.1':
          rule: If the Nekro player uses a Direct Hit action card to destroy an opponent’s
            flagship, they may score the Destroy their Greatest Ship secret objective,
            even if there are some hits remaining that will cause the Nekro player
            to be eliminated once they are assigned. If this would bring the Nekro
            player to ten victory points, they will instead win the game before they
            are eliminated.
    '2':
      rule: After the Nekro player uses the ability of The Alastor, all other players
        will have the opportunity to resolve an “at the start of combat” or an “at
        the start of a round of combat” ability before the Nekro player may resolve
        another ability.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: For example, say the Nekro player owns the Assault Cannon technology,
            and uses the ability of The Alastor to bring the total number of non–fighter
            ships in the combat to three (or more). Other players may then resolve
            one ability each. If their opponent uses an ability that destroys ships,
            such as from their own Assault Cannon, to reduce the number of non–fighter
            ships the Nekro player has in the combat to two (or fewer), then the Nekro
            player will be unable to resolve the ability of their Assault Cannon
    '3':
      rule: Some abilities may destroy The Alastor at the start of a combat before
        the Nekro player has used its ability, such as the Assault Cannon technology.
    '4':
      rule: Ground forces on planets remain there while participating in combat. Effects
        that target units in a space area cannot target these ground forces.
      subrules:
        '4.1':
          rule: When the Nekro player is in a space combat against the Argent player,
            their infantry on planets participating in the combat cannot be targeted
            by the ability of the Argent player’s Strike Wing Alpha II destroyers.
    '5':
      rule: If The Alastor is destroyed during space combat, any ground forces in
        that combat remain in that combat.
    '6':
      rule: If the Nekro player copies another player’s flagship unit upgrade technology
        with one of their Valefar Assimilator technologies during a space combat,
        any ground forces in that combat remain in that combat. If the Nekro player
        starts the space combat copying another player’s flagship unit upgrade technology,
        ground forces cannot participate in that combat, unless the Nekro player stops
        copying that flagship unit upgrade technology during the “start of combat”
        window.
    '7':
      rule: The ground forces in the space area during the combat still retain their
        ability to be transported. Since transported units do not count against capacity
        during combat, these ground forces will not count toward the Nekro player’s
        fleet pool limit.
    '8':
      rule: A mech in the space combat may be targeted with the Direct Hit action
        card if it uses its Sustain Damage ability.
    '9':
      rule: If the Nekro player has one of their Valefar Assimilator tokens on the
        Ul player’s Hel Titan II faction unit upgrade technology, they may use The
        Alastor to have their PDS in the active system participate in the space combat.
- name: Nekro Malleon (Agent)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: If the chosen player is the Muaat player with their commander, Magmus,
        unlocked, they will gain a trade good from it if they spend a token from their
        strategy pool when resolving this ability.
      subrules:
        '1.1':
          rule: That trade good will be gained separately from the other two.
    '2':
      rule: The ability of Nekro Malleon cannot be resolved while another ability
        is resolving. For example, if the Nekro player is targeted by the Spy action
        card, they cannot use the ability of Nekro Malleon to discard one of their
        action cards before Spy resolves.
- name: Nekro Acidos (Commander)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: When the Nekro player gains their third technology and unlocks Nekro Acidos,
        they cannot apply Nekro Acidos to that instance of gaining a technology.
    '2':
      rule: When the Nekro places a Valefar Assimilator token on a technology, they
        are not gaining a technology.
- name: UNIT.DSGN.FLAYESH — Polymorphic Algorithm (Hero)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: When the other player’s units are destroyed, this does not trigger the
        Nekro player’s Technology Singularity ability.
    '2':
      rule: Unit upgrades do not have a color. The Nekro player cannot gain a unit
        upgrade with Polymorphic Algorithm.
- name: Mordred (Mech)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: A Mordred will apply +2 against a player with both Valefar Assimilator
        tokens, and not +4.
