  rules:
    '1':
      rule: If the Jol–Nar player will research several technologies in a row, then
        after each, the player holding Research Agreement may play it. The Jol–Nar
        player does not decide the next technology they will research until after
        the player holding the Research Agreement plays it or declines to.
    '2':
      rule: If a player receives Research Agreement in a transaction immediately after
        the Jol–Nar player researched a technology, that player may play it immediately
        to gain that technology.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: The active player may perform a transaction with each other player
            at most once per turn. As such, the active player cannot receive Research
            Agreement more than once per turn.
        '2.2':
          rule: Once a player has used Research Agreement after the Jol–Nar player
            researches a technology, no other player may use Research Agreement for
            that same Jol–Nar research instance to gain the same technology.
        '2.3':
          rule: If the active player received the Research Agreement on a previous
            turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the
            Jol–Nar player to regain it. They may then play it when the Jol–Nar player
            researches their next technology.
    '3':
      rule: Any deal between the Jol–Nar player and another player regarding when
        Research Agreement will be played, if made before Research Agreement is exchanged,
        is non–binding.
    '4':
      rule: If a faction has a faction–specific unit upgrade as one of their faction
        technologies, they cannot gain that unit upgrade from Research Agreement when
        the Jol–Nar player researches the generic version of that unit upgrade.
    '5':
      rule: Research Agreement may be triggered when the Jol–Nar player reseaches
        a technology outside of the Technology strategy card. For example, it may
        be triggered by the Divert Funding action card, the Focused Research action
        card, the Reveal Prototype action card, the Technology Rider action card,
        the Ixthian Artifact agenda, the Wormhole Research agenda, or the Enigmatic
        Device exploration card.
      subrules:
        '5.1':
          rule: Research Agreement cannot be triggered by a game effect that instructs
            the Jol–Nar player to directly gain a technology, without researching.
            For example, it cannot be triggered by the Fire of the Gashlai Muaat faction
            promissory note, the Plagiarize action card, the Research Grant Reallocation
            agenda, or the Maw of Worlds relic.
        '5.2':
          rule: Research Agreement cannot be triggered when the Jol–Nar player resolves
            Genetic Memory.
- name: E–Res Siphons (Technology)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: E–Res Siphons ability is triggered when the system is activated, even
        if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Jol–Nar player
        this turn.
    '2':
      rule: If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places
        a command counter in a system with the Jol–Nar player’s ships (for example,
        the primary ability of the Diplomacy strategy card), this will not cause E–Res
        Siphons ability to trigger.
- name: Spatial Conduit Cylinder (Technology)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: Other players may use the Deep Space Cannon ability of units in the same
        system as a Jol–Nar player’s unit to produce hits during the Space Cannon
        Offense step.
    '2':
      rule: If the Jol–Nar player moves ships out of a gravity rift, they must still
        roll for removal.
    '3':
      rule: If its move value is high enough, a ship may still travel through other
        systems as it moves to the active system. This will allow a ship with capacity
        to transport units as normal from a system it did not start its movement in.

      rule: Ta Zern cannot be used to reroll dice for an Infantry II resurrection
        ability.

      rule: The Jol–Nar player does not have to meet the prerequisites of the technologies
        they acquire.

        it readied.
