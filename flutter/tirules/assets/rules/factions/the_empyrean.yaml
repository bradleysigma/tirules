cards:
- name: Voidborn
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: This effect also applies outside the Movement step.
    '2':
      rule: The Empyrean player treats nebulae as nebulae and as anomalies for all
        other game purposes.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: When the Empyrean player is the defender during a space combat in
            a nebula, they will receive the +1 to their combat rolls.
- name: Aetherpassage
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The Empyrean player does not decide to use this ability until after the
        other player has activated a system. Any deal made to use this ability before
        the system has been activated is non–binding.
- name: Dark Whispers
- name: Blood Pact (Promissory Note)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: Both players must cast at least one vote to trigger the additional votes.
      subrules:
        '1.1':
          rule: If either player cannot vote on an agenda, then the additional votes
            will not trigger for that agenda.
    '2':
      rule: Blood Pact has no effect while it is in a player’s hand.
    '3':
      rule: Blood Pact is returned when the system is activated, even if the active
        player will perform no hostile acts towards the Empyrean player this turn.
    '4':
      rule: Activating a system containing only the Empyrean player’s structures will
        still cause Blood Pact to be returned.
    '5':
      rule: If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places
        a command counter in a system with the Empyrean player’s units (for example,
        the primary ability of the Diplomacy strategy card), this will not cause Blood
        Pact to be returned.
- name: Dark Pact (Promissory Note)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: A player cannot have more commodities than their commodity value.
    '2':
      rule: If the Empyrean player plays a player’s Trade Agreement promissory note,
        this will count for that player giving the Empyrean player all their commodities.
    '3':
      rule: The trade goods gained from Dark Pact are gained simultaneously with the
        commodities transacted between the two players. As a pair of players is limited
        to one transaction per turn (which must involve the active player) or per
        agenda, the two players cannot then perform a transaction for these trade
        goods on the same turn.
    '4':
      rule: As the trade goods from Dark Pact are gained simultaneously with any commodities
        and/or trade goods transacted, the Mentak player may only use their Pillage
        ability on each player once per Dark Pact transaction.
    '5':
      rule: Dark Pact has no effect while it is in a player’s hand.
    '6':
      rule: Dark Pact is returned when the system is activated, even if the active
        player will perform no hostile acts towards the Empyrean player this turn.
    '7':
      rule: Activating a system containing only the Empyrean player’s structures will
        still cause Dark Pact to be returned.
    '8':
      rule: If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places
        a command counter in a system with the Empyrean player’s units (for example,
        the primary ability of the Diplomacy strategy card), this will not cause Dark
        Pact to be returned.
- name: Aetherstream (Technology)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The Empyrean player does not decide to use this ability until after the
        other player has activated a system. Any deal made to use this ability before
        the system has been activated is non–binding.
    '2':
      rule: A system is not adjacent to itself. If a system with an anomaly is activated,
        Aetherstream will not give any ships +1 to their move value, unless that system
        is adjacent to another anomaly.
- name: Voidwatch (Technology)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The active player chooses which promissory note they give the Empyrean
        player.
- name: Dynamo (Flagship)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: A unit may only use its Sustain Damage ability once in each Assign Hits
        step, even if it is repaired.
    '2':
      rule: A unit that becomes damaged without using its Sustain Damage ability will
        not trigger this effect.
    '3':
      rule: A player may play a Direct Hit action card during the same timing window
        as this ability. If they do so, the ship is destroyed.
    '4':
      rule: Each unit using its Sustain Damage ability creates a separate timing window.
        As such, any excess influence used to repair a ship is wasted, and cannot
        be used to repair a different ship.
      subrules:
        '4.1':
          rule: As an example, The Dark may be exhausted to repair only one ship,
            not two.
- name: Acamar (Agent)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: Exhausting Acamar is a cost. Acamar cannot be used if it is exhausted.
    '2':
      rule: A system that contains a planet destroyed by the Stellar Converter relic,
        and no other planets, is considered to contain no planets.
- name: Xuange (Commander)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: While the agenda phase and the Hacan player’s Trade Convoys promissory
        note allow a player to resolve transactions with all other players, they do
        not make that player neighbors with all other players.
    '2':
      rule: Any movement of ships can trigger this ability, not just movement during
        the Move Ships step of a tactical action.
    '3':
      rule: If the Empyrean player becomes neighbors with all players when the final
        player moves ships into a system containing one of the Empyrean player’s command
        tokens, Xuange will unlock, but the Empyrean player will not be able to resolve
        its ability from that movement.
- name: Conservator Procyon — Multiverse Shift (Hero)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The Empyrean player chooses the order of exploration.
    '2':
      rule: A system that contains a planet destroyed by the Stellar Converter relic,
        and no other planets, is considered to contain no planets. Multiverse Shift
        will place a frontier token in such a system.
- name: Watcher (Mech)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: This effect may cancel a Sabotage action card.
    '2':
      rule: The Watcher must be adjacent to the other player’s units during the timing
        window when the action card is played in order to cancel it.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: In particular, if an action card is played “when/after you activate
            a system” or similar, then the Watcher must be adjacent before any ships
            move during that tactical action.
