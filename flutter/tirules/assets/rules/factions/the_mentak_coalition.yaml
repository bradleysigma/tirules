cards:
- name: Ambush
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do
        not affect dice rolls made when resolving the Ambush ability.
    '2':
      rule: If a cruiser or destroyer is removed before the Mentak player can resolve
        their Ambush ability, that ship cannot be one of the ships used when they
        do resolve their Ambush ability.
    '3':
      rule: The Shields Holding action card may be used to cancel the hit.
    '4':
      rule: A ship may cancel the hit by using its Sustain Damage ability, if present.
      subrules:
        '4.1':
          rule: If the chosen ship does so, the Direct Hit and/or Reflective Shielding
            action cards may be played.
- name: Pillage
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: While the agenda phase and the Hacan player’s Trade Convoys promissory
        note allow a player to resolve transactions with all other players, they do
        not make that player neighbors with the Mentak player.
    '2':
      rule: Effects that force players to give objects to other players are not transactions.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: If Alice plays Bob’s Trade Agreement promissory note, then the Mentak
            player may use Pillage on Alice, but not Bob.
    '3':
      rule: If the Creuss player has units or controls planets in a system with an
        alpha wormhole, and the Mentak player has units or controls planets in a system
        with a beta wormhole, or vice versa, then the Creuss player and Mentak player
        are neighbors. The Mentak player may thus use their Pillage ability against
        the Creuss player.
    '4':
      rule: If the Winnu player owns Lazax Gate Folding, then the Mentak player may
        become neighbors with the Winnu player during the Winnu player’s tactical
        action. If so, the Mentak player may use their Pillage ability during this
        time.
    '5':
      rule: If a player would gain multiple trade goods one at a time, the Mentak
        player can use their Pillage ability for each trade good.
    '6':
      rule: If a game effect instructs a player to convert their commodities to trade
        goods, that player does not gain any trade goods from that effect. The Mentak
        player cannot use their Pillage ability for those trade goods.
    '7':
      rule: The Mentak player may use their Pillage ability even if the transaction
        does not involve trade goods.
    '8':
      rule: The Mentak player may use their Pillage ability against both players involved
        in a transaction.
    '9':
      rule: If the Mentak player resolves a transaction with another player, they
        may then use their Pillage ability against that player.
      subrules:
        '9.1':
          rule: The Mentak player does not decide to use their Pillage ability until
            after the transaction has been resolved. Any deal made to not use their
            Pillage ability before the transaction has been resolved is non–binding.
- name: Promise of Protection (Promissory Note)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: If the player with Promise of Protection in their play area resolves a
        transaction with another player, the Mentak player may still use their Pillage
        ability on that other player.
    '2':
      rule: Promise of Protection has no effect while it is in a player’s hand.
    '3':
      rule: Promise of Protection is returned when the system is activated, even if
        the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Mentak player this
        turn.
    '4':
      rule: Activating a system containing only the Mentak player’s structures will
        still cause Promise of Protection to be returned.
    '5':
      rule: If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places
        a command counter in a system with the Mentak player’s units (for example,
        the primary ability of the Diplomacy strategy card), this will not cause Promise
        of Protection to be returned.
- name: Mirror Computing (Technology)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: If an effect specifically requires that trade goods are spent (for example,
        the Negotiate Trade Routes objective), Mirror Computing does not increase
        the value of those trade goods.
- name: Salvage Operations (Technology)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The produced unit must be paid for.
    '2':
      rule: If the space combat ends in a draw, Salvage Operations has no effect.
    '3':
      rule: If the Mentak player wishes to place a unit using their Salvage Operations
        ability, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they
        can remove a unit of that type from any system that does not contain one of
        their command tokens and place that instead.
    '4':
      rule: If the opponent has a faction specific ship, including their flagship,
        destroyed, the Mentak player may use their Salvage Operations to produce a
        generic ship of the same type, or their Fourth Moon, as appropriate.
    '5':
      rule: The Mentak player cannot produce ground forces using Salvage Operations,
        even if their opponent has the ability to treat a ground force as a ship.
    '6':
      rule: The Mentak player cannot produce a war sun unless they have their war
        sun technology.
- name: Fourth Moon (Flagship)
- name: Suffi An (Agent)
- name: S’ula Mentarion (Commander)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The Mentak player’s opponent chooses which promissory note they give to
        the Mentak player.
- name: Ipswitch, Loose Cannon — Sleeper Cell (Hero)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The Mentak player can trigger the Sleeper Cell ability, their Ambush ability,
        or any other “at the start of a space combat” abilities they have in any order.
    '10':
      rule: If the Fourth Moon is destroyed during combat, but the Mentak player then
        destroys their opponent’s flagship and places the Fourth Moon back into the
        combat, they cannot score the Unveil Flagship objective.
      subrules:
        '10.1':
          rule: If the Mentak player starts the combat without the Fourth Moon, and
            places it during the combat, they may score the Unveil Flagship objective
            if the Fourth Moon is not destroyed.
    '11':
      rule: If a destroyed unit is a ground force or structure, that the other player
        is treating as a ship due to some effect, the Mentak player cannot place that
        unit.
    '12':
      rule: The Mentak player cannot place a war sun unless they have their war sun
        technology.
    '13':
      rule: The opponent may still retreat during combat.
    '2':
      rule: If ships are destroyed before the Sleeper Cell ability is triggered, the
        Mentak player cannot place those units.
    '3':
      rule: Fleet pool limits still apply during combat. However, if the Mentak player
        is at their fleet pool limit, they may still place a unit using this ability,
        but must then immediately remove a unit.
    '4':
      rule: Capacity is not checked during combat. As such, the Mentak player may
        place an unlimited number of fighters into a combat with this ability.
    '5':
      rule: If all of the Mentak player’s ships are destroyed, they may still place
        ships with this ability. If they do, combat will continue.
    '6':
      rule: No costs are paid for the placed units.
    '7':
      rule: Both players will choose and destroy one of their own ships in the active
        system for each hit their opponent produced during each round of combat, before
        the Mentak player places their ships for the Sleeper Cell ability. As such,
        the Mentak player may place a ship that was destroyed in the same round of
        combat, if they destroyed one of their opponent’s ships of the same type,
        even if they had none of that ship type in their reinforcements.
      subrules:
        '7.1':
          rule: When players would use their ships’ Sustain Damage abilities, they
            do so in alternating order, starting with the attacker. If the Mentak
            player uses a Direct Hit action card to destroy one of their opponent’s
            ships, they must then make the choice immediately if they will replace
            it using the Sleeper Cell ability, before any other ships may use their
            Sustain Damage ability. Should the Mentak version of the newly placed
            ship type have a Sustain Damage ability, it may then use it during the
            same combat round.
    '8':
      rule: If the Mentak player wishes to place a unit with this ability, but there
        are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they may remove a unit
        of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens
        and place that instead. This unit will be placed undamaged.
    '9':
      rule: If the opponent has a faction specific ship, including their flagship,
        destroyed, the Mentak player may place a generic ship of the same type, or
        their Fourth Moon, as appropriate.
- name: Moll Terminus (Mech)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: If a player commits a mech to a planet that contains both a Moll Terminus
        mech and a PDS belonging to the Mentak player, then the committed mech cannot
        use its Sustain Damage ability to cancel any Space Cannon hits during that
        invasion.
