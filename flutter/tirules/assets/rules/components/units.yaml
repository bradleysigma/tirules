- name: Dreadnought
- name: Carrier
- name: Cruiser
- name: Destroyer
- name: Fighter
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: Fighters and ground forces do not count towards capacity during combat.
        As such, any number of Fighter II may be in a system during combat, regardless
        of capacity and fleet pool. This will usually only be caused by effects that
        place units in a system during combat. When combat ends however, units will
        need to be removed to meet capacity and fleet pool requirements.
    '2':
      rule: A ship cannot move through a system that contains Fighter II that are
        controlled by another player during the Movement step of a tactical action.
    '3':
      rule: Ships may be moved into, produced in or placed in a system even if doing
        so would exceed the fleet pool limit. However, some of those ships must immediately
        be removed to satisfy the limit. If some of those ships are fighters II, they
        may instead count towards that player’s capacity in that system. If capacity
        is exceeded, fighters or ground forces must be removed to meet the limit.
