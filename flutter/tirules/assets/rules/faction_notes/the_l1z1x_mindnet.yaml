cards:
- name: Assimilate
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: Any space docks that are placed by this ability during a tactical action
        may produce units during the Production step of that tactical action.
    '2':
      rule: If the L1Z1X player resolves their Assimilate ability, and then plays
        the Infiltrate action card, or vice versa, they will replace zero PDS and
        space docks with zero PDS and space docks when they resolve the latter ability.
    '3':
      rule: If the L1Z1X player would have to place a structure, but there are none
        of that type left in their reinforcements, they may remove a structure of
        that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens
        and place that instead.
    '4':
      rule: The L1Z1X player must mandatorily replace every structure. However, if
        there are none of that type in their reinforcements they are not forced to
        do so.
- name: Harrow
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The Planetary Shield ability will prevent the use of the Harrow ability
        on a planet.
    '2':
      rule: The L1Z1X player cannot use their Harrow ability if they are not the active
        player. This will most commonly occur due to the effect of the N’orr player’s
        commander, G’hom Sek’kus.
    '3':
      rule: The L1Z1X player may use their Harrow ability at the end of the round
        in which their last ground force was destroyed. This may cause the combat
        to end in a draw.
    '4':
      rule: During the Bombardment step, each of the L1Z1X player’s units with the
        Bombardment ability is assigned only one planet to bombard. However, during
        ground combat, every unit in the system with the Bombardment ability may use
        it against the planet the ground combat is taking place on.
      subrules:
        '4.1':
          rule: An Annihilator may bombard when using Harrow if that mech is not currently
            participating in ground combat, even if it has been committed to a different
            planet, and has been or will be involved in another ground combat during
            the current invasion.
    '5':
      rule: The L1Z1X player may use the ability of the X–89 Bacterial Weapon Ω technology
        card whenever they bombard.
- name: Cybernetic Enhancements (Promissory Note)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: If the L1Z1X player has no command tokens in their strategy pool, Cybernetic
        Enhancements cannot be played.
- name: Cybernetic Enhancements Ω (Promissory Note)
- name: Inheritance Systems (Technology)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The two resources for Inheritance Systems must be paid in addition to
        and separately from any other costs paid to research the technology. For example,
        if the L1Z1X player is performing the secondary of the Technology strategy
        card, they cannot spend the five resources of [0.0.0] plus one trade good
        to pay for the costs of both Technology and Inheritance Systems. Instead,
        they would have to spend [0.0.0] to pay for the cost of Technology, wasting
        the fifth resource, then spend two trade goods to pay for the cost of Inheritance
        Systems.

        to be replaced. It cannot be replaced if it is moved into or produced in the
        active system later in the turn.
    '2':
      rule: If a player wishes to place a mech, but there are none left in their reinforcements,
        they may remove a mech from any system that does not contain one of their
        command tokens and place that instead. The mech will be placed undamaged.

    '2':
      rule: Ships may transport units only if their origin system does not contain
        one of the L1Z1X player’s command tokens.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: A future rule change will allow a player’s ships to transport units

        another ground combat during the current invasion.
    '2':
      rule: An Annihilator may bombard any one planet during the Bombardment step
        of an invasion.
