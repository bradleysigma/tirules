cards:
- name: The Company
- name: Future Sight
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The Nomad player may only predict agenda outcomes via game effects that
        allow them to do so, e.g. rider action cards.
    '2':
      rule: If the Nomad player predicts multiple different outcomes, and one of those
        outcomes is resolved, they will gain the trade good.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: If the Nomad player predicts an outcome and votes for another outcome
            (via the Xxcha player’s Alliance promissory note), and one of those outcomes
            is resolved, they will gain the trade good.
    '3':
      rule: If the Deadly Plot action card is played, the Nomad will not gain a trade
        good from Future Sight.
- name: The Cavalry (Promissory Note)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: One ship is chosen. That ship retains the flagship’s values and abilities
        until it is destroyed or the combat ends.
    '2':
      rule: If the chosen ship does not usually have the Sustain Damage ability, and
        is damaged during combat, it will remain damaged even after losing the Sustain
        Damage ability.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: The damaged ship may be chosen again if The Cavalry is played by the
            same player during a future combat, regaining the Sustain Damage ability.
            As it is already damaged, it will be unable to use its Sustain Damage
            ability again.
        '2.2':
          rule: The damaged ship will be repaired during the status phase, regardless
            of if it currently has the Sustain Damage ability.
        '2.3':
          rule: In a future combat, the damaged ship may be repaired by the Duranium
            Armor technology. It will be unable to be damaged again unless it has
            regained the Sustain Damage ability.
        '2.4':
          rule: If the Emergency Repairs action card is played, the damaged ship will
            not be repaired unless it currently has the Sustain Damage ability.
- name: Temporal Command Suite (Technology)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The Nomad player may perform a transaction with another player without
        being neighbors with that player.
    '2':
      rule: The Nomad player may perform a transaction with another player even if
        neither player is the active player.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: Temporal Command Suite may allow the Nomad player to perform a transaction
            at a time they usually could not. For example, if the Mentak player exhausts
            their agent, Suffi An, during the strategy phase when another player gains
            the trade goods on the strategy card they chose, the Nomad player may
            use Temporal Command Suite and then perform a transaction with the Mentak
            player.
    '3':
      rule: Temporal Command Suite may allow the Nomad player to perform a second
        transaction with another player during one turn, before or after the regular
        transaction.
    '4':
      rule: An agent cannot be resolved twice in one timing window. If a player’s
        agent is readied immediately after resolving, it cannot immediately resolve
        again.
- name: Memoria (Flagship)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: Only the Memoria is adjacent to systems with a Quantum Manipulator. Other
        ships cannot move between the Memoria’s system and a system containing a Quantum
        Manipulator using this ability.
    '2':
      rule: Other players cannot use the Deep Space Cannon ability of units in the
        same system as a Quantum Manipulator against the Memoria, unless those units
        are adjacent using another adjacency method.
    '3':
      rule: The Memoria cannot retreat to a system containing a Quantum Manipulator,
        unless it is adjacent to that system using another adjacency method.
    '4':
      rule: The Intimidate Council objective requires the system to be adjacent to
        Mecatol Rex. As such, the Nomad player cannot use the Memoria’s ability to
        score this objective. A similar prohibition applies to the Learn the Secrets
        of the Cosmos and Threaten Enemies objectives.
    '5':
      rule: All ship movement is simultaneous. The Nomad player cannot transport a
        Quantum Manipulator into a system, and then use that to move the Memoria into
        that system during the same movement.
    '6':
      rule: The Memoria is adjacent to the system that the Quantum Manipulator is
        in before movement, regardless of if that Quantum Manipulator is transported
        during that movement.
- name: Artuno the Betrayer (Agent)
  rules:
    '1':

      subrules:
        '1.1':
          rule: For example, if the Nomad player successfully predicts the outcome
            of an agenda via the Trade Rider action card, they could put either the
            trade goods gained from the Trade Rider, or from Future Sight, but not
            both.
    '2':
      rule: When a player gains trade goods that were on a strategy card, they do
        not gain them from the supply.
    '3':
      rule: When the Nomad player gains trade goods that were on Artuno the Betrayer,
        they do not gain them from the supply.

            promissory note, the Letnev agent, Viscount Unlenn, and the Sol agent,
            Evelyn DeLouis.
    '2':
      rule: The Roll Dice step occurs after the start of a round of combat. Any effects
        that may be played at the start or end of a round of combat cannot be played
        until the next round of combat.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: This includes the ability of the Duranium Armor or Magen Defense Grid
            technologies, the Fighter Prototype or Morale Boost action cards, the

        that occur “when/after you roll dice” or similar.
      subrules:
        '3.1':
          rule: If The Thundarian is used after the Hacan player has spent trade goods
            for the ability of their flagship, the Wrath of Kenara, those trade goods
            remain spent, but the +1 to combat rolls will not be applied for the subsequent
            dice rolls. The Hacan player may spend trade goods after the subsequent
            dice roll to use the ability of the Wrath of Kenara for the new results.
        '3.2':
          rule: If The Thundarian is used after a player has used the ability of The
            Crown of Thalnos relic, any units that did not produce hits and so were
            destroyed remain destroyed, but the +1 to combat rolls will not be applied
            for the subsequent dice rolls. That player may use the ability of The
            Crown of Thalnos on the subsequent dice roll.
        '3.3':
          rule: If The Thundarian is used after a player has played the Fire Team
            action card, it will be discarded without effect on the subsequent roll.
        '3.4':
          rule: If The Thundarian is used after a player has played the Letnev War
            Funding Î© promissory note, it will be returned without effect on the
            subsequent roll.
        '3.5':
          rule: If the N’orr player’s Valkyrie Particle Weave faction technology would
            produce a hit, that hit is not assigned if The Thundarian is used.

      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: The flagship cannot be produced with abilities that are limited by
            the cost of units, such as the Integrated Economy technology or the Muaat
            player’s agent, Umbat.
        '2.2':
          rule: If the flagship is chosen for the Scuttle action card, the player
            gains 8 trade goods.
    '3':
      rule: The objective elected by the Classified Document Leaks agenda is a public
        objective, not a secret objective. Navarch Feng cannot be unlocked by scoring

            Feng cannot be unlocked by having scored it.
        '3.2':
          rule: Commanders cannot become locked after being unlocked. If the Nomad
            player has only one scored secret objective, and it is elected by the
            Classified Document Leaks agenda, this will have no effect on Navarch
            Feng.

- name: Quantum Manipulator (Mech)
  rules:

      rule: When a Quantum Manipulator uses its Sustain Damage ability to cancel a
        hit produced against a ship, the Direct Hit and Reflective Shielding action
        cards cannot be played, as the Quantum Manipulator is not a ship.
    '2':
      rule: A Quantum Manipulator may use its Sustain Damage ability to cancel any
        hit produced during combat against the Nomad player’s ships, not just hits
        produced by combat rolls. For example, hits produced by anti–fighter barrage
        rolls may be cancelled.

      rule: During a space combat, A Quantum Manipulator cannot be repaired by the
        Duranium Armor technology, as it is not participating in the combat.
