    '3':
      rule: If both the Yssaril player and the Vuil’raith player wish to target the

        they will both be able to capture a ship, resolving in initiative order from
        the active player. Both players will still use the target player’s full commodity
        value to determine which units they may capture. Should the first player to
        resolve capture the last of a type of unit from the target player’s reinforcements,
        the latter player cannot capture a unit of the same type.

        they may resolve the effect.
