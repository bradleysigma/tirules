cards:
- name: Scavenge
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: If the Saar player gains control of multiple planets during one invasion,
        the trade goods are gained one at a time.
    '2':
      rule: When the Saar player gains control of a planet that is not already controlled

        '2.1':
          rule: If the Saar player is to gain control of multiple planets not already

        '2.2':
          rule: If the Saar player has the Naaz–Rokha player’s Alliance promissory

- name: Nomadic
- name: Ragh’s Call (Promissory Note)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: Playing Ragh’s Call will prevent ground combat from occurring on that
        planet.
    '2':
      rule: Any PDS on the planet remain. They might produce hits during the Space
        Cannon Defense step.

    '1':
      rule: The produced unit must be paid for.
    '2':
      rule: The produced unit may move later that same turn, if the Saar player performs
        a tactical action.
    '3':
      rule: A unit may be produced on each of the Saar player’s turns; Chaos Mapping
        is not exhausted.
      subrules:
        '3.1':
          rule: A unit may be produced on the turn the Saar player passes.

        that affect the Saar player’s units located in asteroid fields.
    '5':
      rule: If an asteroid field contains only non–ship units belonging to the Saar
        player, it may still be activated by other players.
- name: Floating Factory (Unit)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: A floating Factory does not count towards the Saar player’s fleet pool.
    '10':
      rule: If a Floating Factory is in a system that contains none of the Saar player’s
        ships, and another player moves ships into that system, the Floating Factory
        is immediately destroyed.
      subrules:
        '10.1':
          rule: This will happen before the Space Cannon Offense step. The Floating
            Factory is destroyed, even if all of the other player’ ships are destroyed
            during this step. Additionally, the Saar player cannot use that Floating
            Factory to resolve a space cannon roll enabled by the Experimental Battlestation
            action card.
        '10.2':
          rule: If all of the other player’s ships are removed due to a gravity rift,
            they will not arrive in the active system. The Floating Factory will not
            be destroyed.
    '11':
      rule: A Floating Factory cannot count towards the Improve Infrastructure or
        Protect the Border objectives.
    '2':
      rule: When a Floating Factory produces ground forces, they may be placed in
        the space area or on a planet they control in that system.
    '3':
      rule: Hits produced by space cannon rolls cannot be assigned to a Floating Factory.
    '4':
      rule: Game effects that affect ship movement, such as the Gravity Drive technology,
        the Flank Speed action card, the Light/Wave Deflector technology, the Antimass
        Deflectors technology, etc, may affect Floating Factories.
    '5':
      rule: A Floating Factory moving through or out of a gravity rift must roll for
        removal. It will receive the +1 to its movement.
    '6':
      rule: If the Saar player announces a retreat during a space combat, but all
        their ships are destroyed that round, any Floating Factories in that system
        are destroyed without retreating.
      subrules:
        '6.1':
          rule: If neither player has ships in the active system after the final round
            of combat, the Floating Factory is not destroyed, and does not retreat.
    '7':
      rule: If the Saar player has their last ship destroyed during combat by a Direct
        Hit action card, a Floating Factory in the system will be blockaded and destroyed,
        even if the Saar player produced enough hits to destroy their opponent’s remaining
        ships during that round of combat.
      subrules:
        '7.1':
          rule: Players alternate using the Sustain Damage ability of their units,
            one at a time, starting with the active player, and continuing until both
            players decline, in a row, to use the Sustain Damage of one of their units.
            If both the Saar player and their opponent have a Direct Hit, then the
            first unit to use Sustain Damage will be the first unit that may be destroyed
            by a Direct Hit. If the Saar player’s unit is the last to be destroyed,
            and leaves no other ships in the system, then a Floating Factory in that
            system will not be blockaded nor destroyed.
    '8':
      rule: When resolving an ability of the Construction strategy card, the Saar
        player must control a planet in the system they place a Floating Factory in.
    '9':
      rule: If an effect allows a Floating Factory to move through a system that contains
        another player’s ships (such as the Light/Wave Deflectors technology), it
        will not be blockaded in systems it moves through.
- name: Son of Ragh (Flagship)
- name: Captain Mendosa (Agent)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The Saar player does not decide to use this ability until after the other
        player has activated a system. Any deal made to use this ability before the
        system has been activated is non–binding.
    '2':
      rule: The effect of Captain Mendosa occurs when the system is activated. The
        move value will be set to the chosen ship’s move value during this window.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: Move value modifying effects that trigger after a system is activated,
            such as the Flank Speed action card or the Gravity Drive technology will
            not be included in Captain Mendosa’s effect.
        '2.2':
          rule: Gravity rifts apply the +1 during movement. This modifier will not
            be included in Captain Mendosa’s effect.
    '3':
      rule: The nebula effect of setting the move value of all ships in that system
        to one will be overwritten by Captain Mendosa’s effect.
- name: Rowl Sarring (Commander)
- name: Gurno Aggero — Armageddon Relay (Hero)
  rules:

- name: Scavenger Zeta (Mech)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The Saar player may perform the Deploy ability or their Scavenge ability
        in either order. If they perform their Scavenge ability first, they may pay
        for the Deploy ability with the gained trade good.
    '2':
      rule: When the Saar player gains control of a planet that is not already controlled
        by another player, they will explore it before the Deploy ability will be
        able to trigger.
    '3':
      rule: If the Saar player gains control of multiple planets, they may deploy
        one Scavenger Zeta to each.
