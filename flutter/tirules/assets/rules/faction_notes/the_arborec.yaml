cards:
- name: Mitosis
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: If the Arborec player produces one or more units with a space dock, and
        produces any infantry with their Letani Warriors, the produced infantry may
        be placed on the same planet as the space dock, regardless of if that planet
        contains any Letani Warriors.
    '2':
      rule: The Arborec player may produce Letani Behemoth with their space docks.
    '3':
      rule: Placing the infantry during the status phase is mandatory (unless the
        Arborec player controls no planets).
- name: Stymie (Promissory Note)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: Stymie has no effect while it is in a player’s hand.
    '2':
      rule: Stymie is returned when the system is activated, even if the active player
        will perform no hostile acts towards the Arborec player this turn.
    '3':
      rule: Activating a system containing only the Arborec player’s structures will
        still cause Stymie to be returned.
    '4':
      rule: If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places
        a command counter in a system with the Arborec player’s units (for example,
        the primary ability of the Diplomacy strategy card), this will not cause Stymie
        to be returned.
- name: Stymie Ω (Promissory Note)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: If a player has no command tokens in their reinforcements, that player
        places one command token of their choice from their command sheet.

      rule: Stymie cannot place a command token in the home system of an eliminated
        player.
- name: Bioplasmosis (Technology)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: 'Any number of infantry may move, but all movement is done simultaneously,
        and no infantry may move beyond an adjacent system. For example, consider
        a series of systems A–B–C. Only systems connected by a “–” are adjacent. In
        this case:'
      subrules:
        '1.1':
          rule: An infantry cannot move from A to B, then B to C.
        '1.2':
          rule: An infantry may move from A to B, while another infantry moves from
            B to C.
        '1.3':

            C to B.
        '1.4':
          rule: An infantry may move from B to A, while another infantry moves from
            B to C.
        '1.5':
          rule: An infantry may move from A to B, while another infantry moves from
            B to A. This will have no meaningful effect.

      rule: Bioplasmosis cannot move Letani Behemoth.
- name: Letani Warrior (Unit)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The Arborec player cannot use the secondary ability of the Warfare strategy
        card to use the Production ability of a Letani Warrior.
    '2':
      rule: When multiple units use their Production ability, the Production value
        is pooled. As such, if the Arborec player has two Letani Warrior I in a system,
        they may produce two infantry for one resource, rather than two.
    '3':
      rule: If Letani Warriors are on different planets, any produced ground forces
        may be split between those planets, regardless of the production value of
        the Letani Warriors on that planet.

  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The produced units must be paid for.
    '2':
      rule: The Duha Menaimon does not have Production. As such, the Sarween Tools
        technology and similar such effects do not apply to the Duha Menaimon.
    '3':
      rule: The Duha Menaimon must be in the system when it is activated for its effect
        to trigger. It will not trigger if it is moved into the active system later
        in the turn.

            more expensive ship to be placed.
    '2':
      rule: If the player wishes to place a ship, but there are none of that type
        left in their reinforcements, they may remove a ship of that type from any
        system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead.
        This ship will be placed undamaged.
    '3':
      rule: A fighter may be placed with Letani Ospha.

        player currently has ships in that system.
    '3':
      rule: No unit is using its Production ability. The Sarween Tools technology
        and similar effects will not apply.
    '4':
      rule: If a ground force is produced, it may be placed on any planet the Arborec
        player controls in that system, regardless of what units, if any, the Arborec

        the space area of that system.
    '5':
      rule: If the Arborec player wishes to place a unit, but there are none of that

        instead. This unit will be placed undamaged.

        has ships in that system.

        and similar effects will not apply.
    '4':
      rule: If a ground force is produced in a system, it may be placed on any planet
