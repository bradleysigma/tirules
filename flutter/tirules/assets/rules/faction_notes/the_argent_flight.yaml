cards:
- name: Zeal
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: Additional votes must be cast for the same outcome as the other votes
        the Argent player cast.
      subrules:
        '1.1':
          rule: If the Argent player abstains or otherwise casts zero votes, they
            cannot cast additional votes.
    '2':
      rule: The Argent player always votes first, even if they are the speaker.
    '3':
      rule: Other players vote in their regular order after the Argent player votes;
        clockwise starting with the player to the left of the speaker (skipping over
        the Argent player as necessary).
- name: Raid Formation
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The Anti–Fighter Barrage step happens during each space combat, even if
        no fighters are present in the system.
    '2':
      rule: Raid Formation occurs when hits are produced, not after hits are assigned.
        As such, cancelling any hits will not prevent an opponent’s ships from becoming
        damaged.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: If any of the anti–fighter barrage dice are rerolled, the number of
            ships that become damaged will depend only on the rerolled values.
    '3':
      rule: The Argent player may choose a damaged ship. This will have no effect.
    '4':
      rule: The chosen ship becomes damaged, it does not use its Sustain Damage ability.
        As such, effects that trigger when a ship uses its Sustain Damage ability,
        such as the Direct Hit or Reflective Shielding action cards, cannot be played.
      subrules:
        '4.1':
          rule: The chosen ship may be repaired by the Duranium Armor technology later
            in the same round of combat.
    '5':
      rule: If the Argent player plays the Waylay action card, hits in excess of their
        opponent’s fighters will first cause chosen ships to become damaged, then
        those same hits must still be assigned.
      subrules:
        '5.1':
          rule: For example, say the opponent has three fighters and three dreadnoughts,
            undamaged. The Argent player plays Waylay, and rolls five hits. This allows
            them to cause two of the dreadnoughts to become damaged. The opponent
            then has to assign all five hits. The final dreadnought may use its Sustain
            Damage ability to cancel one of those hits.
    '6':
      rule: If the Argent player is in combat with the Nekro player, and the Nekro
        player has their mechs participating in the space combat via the effects of
        The Alastor, those mechs may become damaged by the effect of Raid Formation.
- name: Strike Wing Ambuscade (Promissory Note)
- name: Aerie Hololattice (Technology)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The planet with “Production 1” is considered to be on itself for the purposes
        of producing ground forces.
    '2':
      rule: A player with the Light/Wave Deflector technology cannot move their ships
        through systems containing the Argent player's structures, if the Argent player
        owns Aerie Hololattice.
- name: Strike Wing Alpha (Unit)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: When a Strike Wing Alpha II rolls a 9 or 10 for their anti–fighter barrage
        ability, infantry are destroyed at the end of the Roll Dice step. This occurs
        before any ship may use its Sustain Damage ability at the start of the Assign
        Hits step.
    '2':
      rule: Effects that cancel hits, such as the Shields Holding action card, cannot
        prevent the infantry from being destroyed. If an effect rerolls any anti–fighter
        barrage dice, the new result will determine how many infantry are destroyed.
    '3':
      rule: If the last of a player’s ground forces are destroyed by the ability of
        a Strike Wing Alpha II, and that player meets the other conditions for elimination,
        that player is immediately eliminated. All of their units are removed from
        the board, and the Argent player wins the combat.
- name: Quetzecoatl (Flagship)

      rule: Fighters may be moved without being transported.
    '2':

    '3':
      rule: Ships may transport units only if their origin system does not contain
        one of the Argent player’s command tokens.
      subrules:
        '3.1':
          rule: A future rule change will allow a player’s ships to transport units
            from systems that contain that player’s command token when those ships
