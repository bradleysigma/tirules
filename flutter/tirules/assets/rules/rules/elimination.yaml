  rules:
    '1':

        ability. Having it on the game board will not prevent the Arborec player from
        being eliminated. This applies to all similar effects in the game.

      subrules:

      rule: If a player is eliminated, any of their units that are captured remain
        with the player that captured them. When the capturing player would return
        them, the units are instead returned to the game box.
