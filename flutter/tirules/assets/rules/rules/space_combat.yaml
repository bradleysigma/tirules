  rules:
    '78.1':
      rule: If the active player is the only player with ships in the system, they
        skip the Space Combat step of the tactical action and proceeds to the Invasion
        step.
    '78.10':
      rule: After a combat ends, the player with one or more ships remaining in the
        system is the winner of the combat; the other player is the loser of the combat.
        If neither player has a ship remaining, the combat ends in a draw and there
        is no winner.
      subrules:
        78.10.1:
          rule: If the winner of the combat has fighters or ground forces in the space
            area of the active system and those units exceed the capacity of that
            player’s ships in that system, that player must choose and remove any
            excess units.
    '78.2':
      rule: If an ability occurs “before combat”, it occurs immediately before the
        Anti–Fighter Barrage step.
      subrules:
        78.2.1:
          rule: During the first round of a combat, “start of combat” and “start of
            combat round” effects occur during the same timing window.
        78.2.2:
          rule: During the last round of a combat, “end of combat” and “end of combat
            round” effects occur during the same timing window.
    '78.3':
      rule: 'Step 1 – Anti–Fighter Barrage: If this is the first round of a space
        combat, the players may simultaneously use the Anti–Fighter Barrage ability
        of any of their units in the active system.'
      subrules:
        78.3.1:
          rule: If one or both players no longer have ships in the active system after
            resolving this step, the space combat ends immediately.
        78.3.2:
          rule: Players cannot resolve Anti–Fighter Barrage abilities during any rounds
            of space combat other than the first round.
        78.3.3:
          rule: This step still occurs if no fighters are present.
    '78.4':
      rule: 'Step 2 – Announce Retreats: Each player may announce a retreat, beginning
        with the defender.'
      subrules:
        78.4.1:
          rule: A retreat will not occur immediately; the units retreat during the
            Retreat step.
        78.4.2:
          rule: If the defender announces a retreat, the attacker cannot announce
            a retreat during that combat round.
        78.4.3:
          rule: A player cannot announce a retreat if there is not at least one eligible
            system to retreat to.
    '78.5':
      rule: 'Step 3 – Roll Dice: Each player rolls one die for each ship they have
        in the active system; this is called a combat roll. If a unit’s combat roll
        produces a result that is equal to or greater than that unit’s combat value,
        that result produces a hit.'
      subrules:
        78.5.1:
          rule: If a unit’s combat value contains two or more burst icons, the player
            rolls one die for each burst icon instead.
        78.5.2:
          rule: If a player has ships that have different combat values in the active
            system, that player rolls these dice separately.
        78.5.3:
          rule: First, that player should roll all dice for units with a combat value
            of “1”. Then, that player should roll all dice for units with combat value
            of “2”, and then “3”, continuing in numerical order until that player
            has rolled dice for each of their ships.
        78.5.4:
          rule: The player counts each hit their combat rolls produce. The total number
            of hits produced will destroy units during the Assign Hits step.
        78.5.5:
          rule: If a player has an ability that rerolls a die or affects a die after
            it is rolled, that player must resolve such an ability immediately after
            rolling all of their dice.
        78.5.6:
          rule: The attacker makes all of their combat rolls during this step before
            the defender. This procedure is important for abilities that allow a player
            to reroll an opponent’s die.
    '78.6':
      rule: 'Step 4 – Assign Hits: Each player in the combat must choose and destroy
        one of their own ships in the active system for each hit their opponent produced.'
      subrules:
        78.6.1:
          rule: Before assigning hits, players may use their units’ Sustain Damage
            abilities to cancel hits.
        78.6.2:
          rule: When a unit is destroyed, the player who controls that unit removes
            it from the board and places it in their reinforcements.
    '78.7':
      rule: 'Step 5 – Retreat: If a player announced a retreat during step 2, and
        there is still an eligible system for their units to retreat to, they must
        retreat.'
      subrules:
        78.7.1:
          rule: If a player announced a retreat during the Announce Retreats step,
            but their opponent has no ships remaining in the system, the combat immediately
            ends and the retreat does not occur.
        78.7.2:
          rule: To retreat, a player takes all of their ships with a move value in
            the combat and moves them to a single system that is adjacent to the active
            system. That player’s fighters and ground forces in the space area of
            the active system that are unable to move or be transported are removed.
        78.7.3:
          rule: The system that a player’s units retreat to must contain one or more
            of that player’s units, a planet they control, or both. Additionally,
            the system cannot contain ships controlled by another player.
        78.7.4:
          rule: If any of a player’s units successfully retreat and are moved into
            an adjacent system, that player must place a command token from their
            reinforcements in the system to which their units retreated. If that system
            already contains one of their command tokens, that player does not place
            an additional token there. If the player has no command tokens in their
            reinforcements, that player must use one from their command sheet instead.
    '78.8':
      rule: After the Retreat step, if both players still have ships in the active
        system, those players resolve another round of space combat beginning with
        the Announce Retreats step.
    '78.9':
      rule: Space combat ends when only one player – or neither player – has a ship
        in the space area of the active system.
      subrules:
        78.9.1:
          rule: During the last round of a combat, “end of combat” and “end of combat
            round” effects occur during the same timing window.
- name: Notes
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: A player’s fighters and ground forces do not count against capacity during
        combat. At the end of combat, any excess units are removed and returned to
        that player’s reinforcements.
    '10':
      rule: While retreating, a player cannot transport more fighters and/or ground
        forces than they have capacity in the retreating ships.
    '11':
      rule: Capacity is checked after the winner of a space combat is determined.
        As such, it is possible to win a space combat with only fighters remaining,
        before removing those fighters due to lack of capacity.

        Antimass Deflectors technology.

        Reactor Muaat factional technology.

            nebula.
    '5':
      rule: A player may attempt to retreat from a combat in a gravity rift, but will
        still be affected by it. See the gravity rift page for more details.
    '6':
      rule: If a player only has fighters I in the combat when they retreat, those
        will be removed from the board, and they will not place a command token in
        an adjacent system.
    '7':
      rule: The Nav Suite action card will not allow a player to ignore an anomaly
        while retreating.
    '8':
      rule: The Dark Energy Tap technology allows a player to retreat into a system
        that does not contain their ships or a planet they control.
    '9':
      rule: Modifying the move value of a ship will have no effect when retreating.
        Retreats are limited to adjacent systems.
