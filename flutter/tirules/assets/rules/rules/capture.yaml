        17.3.1:
          rule: Captured fighters and infantry do not belong to any player and are

  rules:
    '1':
      rule: For more information, see the Vuil’raith faction notes page.
    '2':
      rule: Units are returned as soon as a space dock is blockaded. If this occurs
        at the end of the Space Combat step of a tactical action, the units will be
        returned before the Invasion step, in which the space dock could potentially
        be destroyed.
    '3':
      rule: A captured unit may only be returned to the player that originally owned
        it, and not to another player.
    '4':
      rule: The Nekro player and the Yssaril player are able to capture units by copying
        the Vuil’raith player’s abilities, but they will be unable to spend the captured
        units.
    '5':
      rule: If a player is eliminated, any of their units that are captured remain
        with the player that captured them. When the capturing player would return
        them, the units are instead returned to the game box.
    '6':
      rule: If a player captures their own units, they cannot be returned to that
        player’s reinforcements, unless instructed to do so by a game effect.
      subrules:
        '6.1':
          rule: That player cannot produce or place those units, except by effects
            that allow that player to use captured units.
    '7':
      rule: If a player has all of their units of one type on the game board or captured,
        and so have none in their reinforcements, and would place a unit of that type,
        they may remove a unit from any system on the game board that does not contain
        one of their command tokens and place that unit in their reinforcements, before
        placing that unit on the game board.
