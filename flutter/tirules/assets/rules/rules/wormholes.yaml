  rules:
    '1':
      rule: A system with a wormhole is not an anomaly.
    '2':
      rule: If a system contains multiple wormholes of the same type, those are treated
        as separate wormholes.
    '3':
      rule: A system cannot be adjacent to itself, even if it has multiple wormholes
        in it.
    '4':
      rule: A player chooses the path of adjacent systems each ship moves through
        during movement. If two systems on that path are adjacent because of a wormhole,
        that ship moves through that wormhole.
      subrules:
        '4.1':
          rule: If the two systems are adjacent because of a wormhole and because
            of a shared edge or another reason, the player may choose whether or not
            the ship moves through the wormhole.
        '4.2':
          rule: If the two systems are adjacent because of two types of wormholes,
            the player chooses which type of wormhole the ship moves through.
        '4.3':
          rule: A player may move a ship back and forth through a wormhole between
            two systems any number of times, if its movement value is high enough.
    '5':
      rule: For more information on how the Creuss interact with wormholes, see their
        faction notes page.
