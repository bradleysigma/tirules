- name: Rules Reference
  rules:
    '90.1':
      rule: Each player places any technology they have gained faceup near their faction
        sheet. For the duration of the game, they own any technology cards they gain
        and can use the abilities on those cards.
    '90.10':
      rule: A player cannot research a faction technology that does not match their
        faction.
    '90.11':
      rule: When researching technology, a player must satisfy each of a technology’s
        prerequisites to research it. To satisfy a technology’s prerequisites, that
        player must own one technology of the matching color for each prerequisite
        symbol on the technology card they wish to research.
      subrules:
        90.11.1:
          rule: Prerequisites symbols are displayed as symbols on the lower–left corner
            of the card.
        90.11.2:
          rule: Unit upgrade technologies do not have a color and do not satisfy prerequisites.
        90.11.3:
          rule: Players may use certain abilities or technology specialties to ignore
            some prerequisites.
    '90.12':
      rule: When researching technology, a player can exhaust a planet they control
        that has a technology specialty to ignore one prerequisite symbol of the matching
        type on the technology card they are researching.
    '90.13':
      rule: If the planet card is already exhausted, it cannot be used to ignore a
        prerequisite.
    '90.14':
      rule: Basic units printed on faction sheets are not technologies and are not
        eligible targets for Valefar Assimilator.
    '90.15':
      rule: If a player becomes eliminated while one of their technologies has a Valefar
        Assimilator token on it, the Nekro Virus player places that technology in
        their play area; it is not removed from the game.
    '90.16':
      rule: If a Valefar Assimilator token is removed from the Saar Floating Factory
        unit upgrade, each of the Nekro Virus’ space docks must be placed on an eligible
        planet they control in that space dock’s system, or the space dock is returned
        to their reinforcements.
    '90.17':
      rule: If a Valefar Assimilator token is removed from a war sun unit upgrade
        and the Nekro Virus player does not have the standard war sun unit upgrade,
        each of the Nekro Virus player’s war suns are returned to their reinforcements.
    '90.18':
      rule: The Nekro Virus player may upgrade their units with units of the same
        type (e.g., “dreadnought” or “infantry”) even if those unit’s names do not
        match. If the Nekro Virus gains a unit upgrade technology of the same unit
        type as a unit upgrade technology they already have, the previous upgrade
        is removed, and they must use the same Valefar Assimilator token that was
        used to copy the previous upgrade.
    '90.19':
      rule: When a Valefar Assimilator token is on a technology, that technology’s
        color and type count toward objectives.
    '90.2':
      rule: A player does not own any technology card that is in their technology
        deck.
    '90.3':
      rule: A player can gain a technology card from their technology deck by researching
        technology.
      subrules:
        90.3.1:
          rule: Both the primary and secondary abilities of the Technology strategy
            card allow a player to research a technology.

        deck. A player can look through their technology deck at any time.
    '90.5':
      rule: If an ability instructs a player to gain a technology, they do not research
        it; they take it from their technology deck and place it in their play area,
        ignoring prerequisites.
    '90.6':
      rule: Some technologies are unit upgrades. Unit upgrades share a name with a

        90.6.1:
          rule: Players place any unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction
            sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.
    '90.7':
      rule: Each technology that is not a unit upgrade has a colored symbol displayed
        in the lower–right corner of the card and on its card back that indicates
        that technology’s color.
      subrules:
        90.7.1:
          rule: A technology’s color has no inherent game effect; however, each technology
            a player owns can satisfy a prerequisite of a matching color when researching
            other technology.
        90.7.2:
          rule: Unit upgrades do not have a color and do not satisfy prerequisites.

    '90.8':
      rule: Most technology cards have a column of colored symbols displayed in the
        lower–left corner of the card. Each symbol in this column is a prerequisite.
      subrules:
        90.8.1:
          rule: A technology card’s prerequisites indicate the number and color of
            technologies a player must own to research that technology card.
    '90.9':
      rule: To research technology, a player gains that technology card from their
        technology deck and places it in their play area near their faction sheet.

          rule: Players place any unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction
            sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.
