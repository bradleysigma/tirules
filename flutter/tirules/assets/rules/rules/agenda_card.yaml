    '7.2':
      rule: Laws can permanently change the rules of the game.
    '7.3':
      rule: When resolving a law, if a “For” outcome received the most votes, or if
        the law requires an election, the law’s ability becomes a permanent part of

        the common play area or in a player’s play area, as dictated by the card.

        that player owns that law.

        Place that card on the top of the agenda card discard pile.

        the outcome and discard the agenda.

      rule: Directives provide one–time game effects.
    '7.8':
      rule: When resolving a directive, players resolve the outcome that received
