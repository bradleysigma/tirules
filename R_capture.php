<style> .lrr > li:before, .lrr > h2 > li:before {content: '17.' counter(item, decimal);} </style>
<p>Some abilities instruct a player to capture a unit, preventing the unit&rsquo;s original owner from using it.</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
    <li>If a player captures a non&ndash;fighter ship or mech, they place it on their faction sheet. When such a unit is returned, it is placed into the reinforcements of the original owner.</li>
    <li>A captured non&ndash;fighter ship or mech is returned under the following circumstances:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If the player who captured the unit agrees to return it as part of a transaction.</li>
        <li>If an ability instructs the capturing player to return the unit as part of an ability&rsquo;s cost.</li>
        <li>If the player whose unit was captured blockades a space dock of the player who captured the unit.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>If a player captures a fighter or infantry, it is placed in its reinforcements instead of on the capturing player&rsquo;s faction sheet; the capturing player places a fighter or infantry token from the supply on their faction sheet instead.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Captured fighters and infantry do not belong to any player and are returned only when an ability instructs the capturing player to do so.</li>
        <li>Captured fighters and infantry cannot be returned as part of a transaction.</li>
        <li>Captured fighters and infantry are not returned as the result of a blockade.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>When a captured fighter or infantry is returned, it is placed in the supply.</li>
    <li>While a unit is captured, it cannot be produced or placed by its original owner until it is returned.</li>
    <li>If one or more of a player&rsquo;s space docks is being blockaded, that player cannot capture units from the blockading players.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Notes</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>For more information, see the <a href="/F_vuilraith">Vuil&rsquo;raith faction notes page</a>.</li>
    <li>A captured unit may only be returned to the player that originally owned it, and not to another player.</li>
    <li>The Nekro player and the Yssaril player are able to capture units by copying the Vuil&rsquo;raith player&rsquo;s abilities, but they will be unable to spend the captured units.</li>
    </ol>
