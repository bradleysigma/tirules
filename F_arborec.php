<h1>Mitosis</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the Arborec player produces one or more units with a space dock, and produces any infantry with their Letani Warriors, the produced infantry may be placed on the same planet as the space dock, regardless of if that planet contains any Letani Warriors.</li>
    <li>The Arborec player may produce Letani Behemoth with their space docks.</li>
    <li>Placing the infantry during the status phase is mandatory (unless the Arborec player controls no planets).</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Stymie <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li><i>Stymie</i> has no effect while it is in a player&rsquo;s hand.</li>
    <li><i>Stymie</i> is returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Arborec player this turn.</li>
    <li>Activating a system containing only the Arborec player&rsquo;s structures will still cause <i>Stymie</i> to be returned.</li>
    <li>If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Arborec player&rsquo;s units (for example, the primary ability of the <i>Diplomacy</i> strategy card), this will not cause <i>Stymie</i> to be returned.</li>
    </ol>

    </ol>

<h1>Bioplasmosis <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Any number of infantry may move, but all movement is done simultaneously, and no infantry may move beyond an adjacent system. For example, consider a series of systems A&ndash;B&ndash;C. Only systems connected by a &ldquo;&ndash;&rdquo; are adjacent. In this case:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>An infantry cannot move from A to B, then B to C.</li>
        <li>An infantry may move from A to B, while another infantry moves from B to C.</li>
        <li>An infantry may move from A to B, while another infantry moves from C to B.</li>
        <li>An infantry may move from B to A, while another infantry moves from B to C.</li>
        <li>An infantry may move from A to B, while another infantry moves from B to A. This will have no meaningful effect.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><i>Bioplasmosis</i> cannot move Letani Behemoth.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Letani Warrior <sub>(Unit)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Arborec player cannot use the secondary ability of the <i>Warfare</i> strategy card to use the <sc>Production</sc> ability of a Letani Warrior.</li>
    <li>When multiple units use their <sc>Production</sc> ability, the <sc>Production</sc> value is pooled. As such, if the Arborec player has two Letani Warrior I in a system, they may produce two infantry for one resource, rather than two.</li>
    <li>If Letani Warriors are on different planets, any produced ground forces may be split between those planets, regardless of the production value of the Letani Warriors on that planet.<li>
    </ol>

<h1>Duha Menaimon <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The produced units must be paid for.</li>
    <li>The <i>Duha Menaimon</i> does not have <sc>Production</sc>. As such, the <i>Sarween Tools</i> technology and similar such effects do not apply to the <i>Duha Menaimon</i>.</li>
    <li>The <i>Duha Menaimon</i> must be in the system when it is activated for its effect to trigger. It will not trigger if it is moved into the active system later in the turn.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Letani Ospha <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The replaced ship is not destroyed. The replacing ship is not produced.</li>
    <ol><li>The <i>Sarween Tools</i> technology and similar effects will not allow a more expensive ship to be placed.</li></ol>
    <li>If the player wishes to place a ship, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they may remove a ship of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Dirzuga Rophal <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The produced unit must be paid for.</li>
    <li>The unit is produced before ships move. A ship may be produced if no other player currently has ships in that system.</li>
    <li>No unit is using its <sc>Production</sc> ability. The <i>Sarween Tools</i> technology and similar effects will not apply.</li>
    <li>If a ground force is produced, it may be placed on any planet the Arborec player controls in that system, regardless of what units, if any, the Arborec player has on that planet. The produced ground force may also be placed in the space area of that system.</li>
    <li>If the Arborec player wishes to place a unit, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they may remove a unit of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead.</li>

<h1>Letani Miasmiala &mdash; Ultrasonic Emitter <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The produced units must all be paid for.</li>
    <li>A ship may be produced in the system only if no other player currently has ships in that system.</li>
    <li>No unit is using its <sc>Production</sc> ability. The <i>Sarween Tools</i> technology and similar effects will not apply.</li>
    <li>If a ground force is produced in a system, it may be placed on any planet the Arborec player controls in that system, regardless of what units, if any, the Arborec player has on that planet. The produced ground force may also be placed in the space area of that system.</li>

<h1>Letani Behemoth <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Arborec player may produce Letani Behemoth with their space docks.</li>
    <li>The Arborec player cannot use the secondary ability of the Warfare strategy card to use the <sc>Production</sc> ability of a Letani Behemoth.</li>
