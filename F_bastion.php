<h1>Liberate</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the Bastion player gains control of an uncontrolled planet, they may choose if they resolve <sc>Liberate</sc> before or after they explore that planet.</li>
    <ol><li>If they explore first, and the number of infantry or the resource value of the planet changes while resolving the exploration, then the new values will be used when resolving <sc>Liberate</sc>.</li></ol>
    <li>The number of mechs is irrelevant for determining which effect to resolve.</li>

<h1>Proxima Targeting VI <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When the Bastion player makes the <sc>Bombardment</sc> roll against their own units, they will be able to cancel a hit for each of their present galvanized units.</li>
    <li>Other players with galvanised units cannot cancel the <sc>Bombardment</sc> hits produced by <i>Proxima Targeting VI</i>.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>4X31C &ldquo;Helios&rdquo; <sub>(Unit)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The <sc>Production</sc> value of the 4X31C &ldquo;Helios&rdquo; will be calculated from the modified resource value of the planet, after the increase from the 4X31C &ldquo;Helios&rdquo; present.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>The Egeiro <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the Bastion player controls multiple planets in a system, <i>The Egeiro</i> will apply +1 to its combat rolls just once.</li>
    <li>If the Bastion player controls a planet in a system, and other players control other planets in that system, <i>The Egeiro</i> will still apply +1 to its combat rolls from that system.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Dame Briar <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Any type of unit in the same system may be galvanized; it need not match the type of the destroyed unit.</li>
    <ol><li>A structure may be galvanized this way.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Nip and Tuck <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Bastion player&rsquo;s action cards may still be cancelled by other game effects.</li>
    <li>If the Nekro player already has a Valefar Assimilator token on one of the Bastion player&rsquo;s components, it will remain there when Nip and Tuck are unlocked.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Lura Keen &mdash; Entity 4X41A &ldquo;Apollo&rdquo; <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Any combat roll modifiers will not apply to the dice roll for <i>Entity 4X41A &ldquo;Apollo&rdquo;</i>.</li>
    <li>Units can only be destroyed by the dice specifically allocated to it.</li>
    <li>Effects that cancel hits, such as <sc>Sustain Damage</sc>, cannot be used to prevent units from being destroyed.</li>
    <li>All units belonging to other players in the system may be destroyed, including structures.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If <i>Entity 4X41A &ldquo;Apollo&rdquo;</i> is resolved during combat, units that belong to another player other than the Bastion player&rsquo;s opponent could be destroyed.</li>
        <li>If <i>Entity 4X41A &ldquo;Apollo&rdquo;</i> is resolved during a space combat, ground forces on planets or being transported in that system could be destroyed.</li>
        <li>If <i>Entity 4X41A &ldquo;Apollo&rdquo;</i> is resolved during a ground combat, ground forces on other planets or units in the space area of that system could be destroyed.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>During combat, both players assign hits simultaneously. If the Bastion player wishes to use <i>Entity 4X41A &ldquo;Apollo&rdquo;</i> after destroying one of their units by assigning a hit to it, their opponent would first finish assigning the hits produced by the Bastion player. Only then could the Bastion player resolve <i>Entity 4X41A &ldquo;Apollo&rdquo;</i>, rolling for just their opponent&rsquo;s units that were not destroyed by the assigned hits.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Before assigning hits, players may cancel the produced hits by using the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability of their units in the combat, one at a time, starting with the active player (intermixed with any other abilities either player wishes to resolve during the same window). Should any of the Bastion player&rsquo;s units be destroyed by a <i>Direct Hit</i> action card, then they can immediately trigger <i>Entity 4X41A &ldquo;Apollo&rdquo;</i>. They will roll dice for all of their opponent&rsquo;s remaining units in the system, which may include some units that their opponent would have otherwise gone on to cancel a hit with by using its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability. Once <i>Entity 4X41A &ldquo;Apollo&rdquo;</i> has finished resolving, both players must assign any remaining hits; they may cancel some number of these by using the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability of any surviving units in the combat.</li>
        <li>During the <b>Space Cannon Offense</b> step of a tactical action, players resolve the <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability of their eligible units starting with the active player, and going around the table in a clockwise order. Each player will make their space cannon roll and have the hits assigned, likely destroying some units, before the next player begins their own space cannon roll. Should the Bastion player have one of their units destroyed by another player&rsquo;s space cannon roll, and choose to use the ability of <i>Entity 4X41A &ldquo;Apollo&rdquo;</i>, then in doing so they destroy a unit with the <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability, that unit will not perform a space cannon roll if the player that owns that unit has not yet made their space cannon roll.</li>
