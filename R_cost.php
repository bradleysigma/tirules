<p>Cost is an attribute of some units that is presented on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards. A unit&rsquo;s cost determines the number of resources a player must spend to produce that unit.</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
    <li>To produce a unit, a player must spend a number of resources equal to or greater than the cost of the unit they are producing.</li>
    <li>If the cost is accompanied by two icons &ndash; typically for fighters and ground forces &ndash; a player produces two of that unit for that cost.</li>
    <li>If a unit does not have a cost, it cannot be produced.</li>
    <ol><li>Structures do not have costs and are usually placed by resolving the <i>Construction</i> strategy card.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Notes</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Whenever a unit is produced, its cost must be paid, unless the effect that is producing the unit explicitly says otherwise.</li>
    <li>A player does not have to pay a unit&rsquo;s cost to resolve that unit&rsquo;s <sc>Deploy</sc> ability. However, the <sc>Deploy</sc> ability itself may have a cost that must be paid.</li>
    </ol>
