<style> .lrr > li:before, .lrr > h2 > li:before {content: '77.' counter(item, decimal);} </style>
<p>A unit that has the <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability can use it during two different steps of a player&rsquo;s tactical action: after the <b>Move Ships</b> substep (<b>Space Cannon Offense</b>) and during an invasion (<b>Space Cannon Defense</b>).</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
    <li>A player is <b>not</b> required to be the active player to use their <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability of their units.</li>
    <h2><li>Space Cannon Offense</li></h2>
    <p>During a tactical action, after the <b>Move Ships</b> substep of the <b>Movement</b> step, beginning with the active player and proceeding clockwise, each player may use the <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability of each of their units in the active system by performing the following steps:</p>
    <li><b>Step 1 &ndash; Roll  Dice</b>: The player rolls dice for each of their units in the active system that has the <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability; this is a space cannon roll. One hit is produced for each result that is equal to or greater than the unit&rsquo;s <sc>Space Cannon</sc> value.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>A unit&rsquo;s <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability is presented along with a unit&rsquo;s attributes on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards.</li>
        <li><sc>Space Cannon</sc> is displayed as &ldquo;<sc>Space Cannon</sc> X (&times;Y).&rdquo; The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled. Not all <sc>Space Cannon</sc> abilities are accompanied by a (Y) value; a space cannon roll for such a unit consists of one die.</li>
        <li>If a player has a PDS unit upgrade technology, they can use the <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability of their PDS units that are in systems that are adjacent to the active system. The hits are still assigned to units in the active system.</li>
        <li>Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect space cannon rolls.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>This ability can be used even if no ships were moved during the <b>Move Ships</b> step.</li>
    <li><b>Step 2 &ndash; Assign  Hits</b>: The player whose units have been targeted by <sc>Space Cannon</sc> must choose and destroy one of their ships in the active system for each hit result produced against their units.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Players other than the active player must target the active player&rsquo;s units.</li>
        <li>If the active player is using the <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability of their units, they choose a player who has ships in the active system. That player must choose and destroy one of their ships in the active system for each hit the space cannon roll produced.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><li>Space Cannon Defense</li></h2>
    <p>During the invasion step of a tactical action, after ground forces have been committed to land on planets, players other than the active player can resolve the <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability of their units on those planets by performing the following steps:</p>
    <li><b>Step 1 &ndash; Roll Dice</b>: Each player may use the <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability of each of their units on the invaded planet by rolling a specific number of dice for each of those units; this is called a space cannon roll. A hit is produced for each die roll that is equal to or greater than the unit&rsquo;s <sc>Space Cannon</sc> value.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If a unit has a <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability, it is present on its faction sheet and technology cards.</li>
        <li><sc>Space Cannon</sc> is displayed as &ldquo;<sc>Space Cannon</sc> X (&times;Y).&rdquo; The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled. Not all <sc>Space Cannon</sc> abilities are accompanied by a (Y) value; a space cannon roll for such a unit consists of one die.</li>
        <li>Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect space cannon rolls.</li>
        <li>Game effects that allow the use of <sc>Space Cannon</sc> abilities against ships in adjacent systems have no effect during Space Cannon Defense.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><b>Step 2 &ndash; Assign Hits</b>: The active player must choose and destroy one of their ground forces on the planet for each hit the space cannon roll produced.</li>
    <ol><li>Hits can only be assigned to units that are on the same planet as the units using the <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Notes</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The <b>Space Cannon Offense</b> step happens before combat. Any secret objectives that require winning a combat or similar cannot be scored if all of one player&rsquo;s ships in a system are destroyed during this step.</li>
    <li>If a player chooses to use the <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability of their units, they must do so for all of their eligible units with the <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability. This includes units in adjacent systems, if applicable.</li>
    <ol><li>A player that chooses to use the <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability of their units may choose whether or not they use the ability of the <i>Plasma Scoring</i> technology, if they own it.</li></ol>
    <li>A player may use the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability of a ship in the active system to cancel a hit produced during the <b>Space Cannon Offense</b> step.</li>
    <li>A player may use the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability of a mech committed to a planet to cancel a produced during the <b>Space Cannon Defense</b> step by a unit on that planet.</li>
    <li>A player cannot assign hits produced by a space cannon roll to their own units.</li>
    <li>The &ldquo;0&rdquo; side of the d10 represents a result of 10.</li>
    </ol>
