    <li>If the Mahact player wins a combat against a player that has no command tokens in their reinforcements, and none of their command tokens are on the Mahact player&rsquo;s command sheet, that player must choose one of their command tokens on their command sheet to remove and place on the Mahact player&rsquo;s command sheet.</li>
