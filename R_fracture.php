<h1>Notes</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Fracture consists of additional systems beyond the regular bounds of the game map.</li>
    <li>When a player gains their breakthrough, they roll a dice. On a result of 1 or 10, The Fracture enters play. Other game effects may also bring The Fracture into play.</li>
    <ol><li>The &ldquo;0&rdquo; side of the d10 represents a result of 10.</li></ol>
    <li>When The Fracture enters play, it is placed against the edge of the regular game map.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The placement location of The Fracture is arbitrary, and should have no mechanical effect on the game state. The Fracture may be moved if required at a later point during the game.</li>
        <li>All systems in The Fracture, as well as the systems of the regular game map that they are touching, are considered to be on the edge of the game board.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>When The Fracture is brought into play, neutral units are placed on the planets in The Fracture as well as the space area of those planets&rsquo; systems, as indicated on the reverse side of The Fracture tiles.</li>
    <li>When The Fracture is brought into play, several ingress tokens will be placed on the game board. Several systems in The Fracture contain a printed egress. Each ingress is adjacent to each egress, and vice versa. An ingress is not adjacent to an ingress and an egress is not adjacent to an egress.</li>
    <ol><li>With sufficient movement, a ship could move from a system containing an ingress in the regular game map, into a system containing an egress within The Fracture, and then out to a different system containing an ingress in the regular game map. A ship could also do the reverse to travel from an egress to a different egress via an ingress.</li></ol>
    <li>If The Fracture was brought into play as a result of a player rolling a dice upon gaining their breakthrough, they will place ingress tokens according to the synergy on their breakthrough. For each color of technology in their breakthrough&rsquo;s synergy, they choose three planets with a matching technology specialty, and place an ingress token in that planet&rsquo;s system.</li>
    <ol><li>If there are fewer than three planets with a technology specialty of a given color, as many planets as possible are chosen.</li></ol>
    <li>If a different game effect places The Fracture into play, or The Fracture enters play because of the Nekro player&rsquo;s breakthrough (which does not have a synergy), then the player that caused The Fracture to enter play chooses one planet with a technology specialty for each of the four colors of technology, and places ingress tokens in each of those planets&rsquo; systems.</li>
    <li>If one system contains two planets with a technology specialty, only one of those planets may be chosen when placing ingress tokens.</li>
    <li>After ingress tokens are placed with either of these two methods, one additional ingress token is placed. If Thunder&rsquo;s Edge is on the game board, then an ingress token is place into its system. Otherwise, an ingress token is placed into the Mecatol Rex system.</li>
    <li>A system cannot contain two or more ingress tokens.</li>
    <li>When a player gains control of a planet in The Fracture that is not already controlled by another player, they draw one relic card.</li>
    </ol>
