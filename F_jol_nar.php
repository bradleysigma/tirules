<h1>Fragile</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The <sc>Fragile</sc> ability does not affect anti&ndash;fighter barrage, bombardment or space cannon rolls.</li>
    <li>The effect of the <sc>Fragile</sc> ability is mandatory.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Brilliant</h1>

<h1>Research Agreement <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li><i>Research Agreement</i> is only triggered by the Jol&ndash;Nar player researching a technology. It will not be triggered if the Jol&ndash;Nar directly gains a technology.</li>
    <li>If the Jol&ndash;Nar player will research several technologies in a row, then after each, the player holding <i>Research Agreement</i> may play it. The Jol&ndash;Nar player does not decide the next technology they will research until after the player holding the <i>Research Agreement</i> plays it or declines to.</li>
    <li>If a player receives <i>Research Agreement</i> in a transaction immediately after the Jol&ndash;Nar player researched a technology, that player may play it immediately to gain that technology.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The active player may perform a transaction with each other player at most once per turn. As such, the active player cannot receive <i>Research Agreement</i> more than once per turn.</li>
        <li>Once a player has used <i>Research Agreement</i> after the Jol&ndash;Nar player researches a technology, no other player may use <i>Research Agreement</i> for that same Jol&ndash;Nar research instance to gain the same technology.</li>
        <li>If the active player received the <i>Research Agreement</i> on a previous turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Jol&ndash;Nar player to regain it. They may then play it when the Jol&ndash;Nar player researches their next technology.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Any deal between the Jol&ndash;Nar player and another player regarding when <i>Research Agreement</i> will be played, if made before <i>Research Agreement</i> is exchanged, is non&ndash;binding.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>E&ndash;Res Siphons <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li><i>E&ndash;Res Siphons</i> ability is triggered when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Jol&ndash;Nar player this turn.</li>
    <li>If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Jol&ndash;Nar player&rsquo;s ships (for example, the primary ability of the <i>Diplomacy</i> strategy card), this will not cause <i>E&ndash;Res Siphons</i> ability to trigger.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Spatial Conduit Cylinder <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Other players may use the <sc>Deep Space Cannon</sc> ability of units in the same system as a Jol&ndash;Nar player&rsquo;s unit to produce hits during the <b>Space Cannon Offense</b> step.</li>
    <li>If the Jol&ndash;Nar player moves ships out of a gravity rift, they must still roll for removal.</li>
    <li>If its move value is high enough, a ship may still travel through other systems as it moves to the active system. This will allow a ship with capacity to transport units as normal from a system it did not start its movement in.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>J.N.S. Hylarim <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    </ol>

<h1>Doctor Sucaban <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    </ol>

<h1>Ta Zern <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>&ldquo;Combat&rdquo; is a unit attribute, not a unit ability.</li>
    <li>The Ta Zern may be used to reroll dice for an Infantry II resurrection ability.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Rin, The Master&rsquo;s Legacy <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Jol&ndash;Nar player does not have to meet the prerequisites of the technologies they acquire.</li>
    <li>All replacements happen simultaneously. If this ability returns a specific technology, it cannot then be regained via this ability.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Shield Paling <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Shield Paling itself is still affected by the <sc>Fragile</sc> ability.</li>
    </ol>
