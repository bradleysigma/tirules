<h1>Fighter</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Fighters and ground forces do not count towards capacity during combat. As such, any number of Fighter II may be in a system during combat, regardless of capacity and fleet pool. This will usually only be caused by effects that place units in a system during combat. When combat ends however, units will need to be removed to meet capacity and fleet pool requirements.</li>
    <li>A ship cannot move through a system that contains Fighter II that are controlled by another player during the <b>Movement</b> step of a tactical action.</li>
    <li>Ships may be moved into, produced in or placed in a system even if doing so would exceed the fleet pool limit. However, some of those ships must immediately be removed to satisfy the limit. If some of those ships are fighters II, they may instead count towards that player&rsquo;s capacity in that system. If capacity is exceeded, fighters or ground forces must be removed to meet the limit.</li>

<h1>Infantry</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If a player controls no planets in their home system, at the start of their turn, any Infantry II that have been placed on that player&rsquo;s Infantry II unit upgrade technology card are returned to that player&rsquo;s reinforcements.</li>
    <li>A player need not use one of their twelve plastic infantry units to represent the infantry on their Infantry II unit upgrade card that will be placed in their home system at the start of their next turn, and may use cardboard infantry tokens to represent any and all of these infantry.</li>
