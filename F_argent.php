    <li>Additional votes must be cast for the same outcome as the other votes the Argent player cast.</li>
    <ol><li>If the Argent player abstains or otherwise casts zero votes, they cannot cast additional votes.</li></ol>

<h1>Raid Formation</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The <b>Anti&ndash;Fighter Barrage</b> step happens during each space combat, even if no fighters are present in the system.</li>
    <li><sc>Raid Formation</sc> occurs when hits are produced, not after hits are assigned. As such, cancelling any hits will not prevent an opponent&rsquo;s ships from being damaged.</li>
    <ol><li>If any of the anti&ndash;fighter barrage dice are rerolled, the number of ships that become damaged will depend only on the rerolled values.</li></ol>
    <li>The Argent player may choose a damaged ship. This will have no effect.</li>
    <li>The chosen ship becomes damaged, it does not use its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability. As such, effects that trigger when a ship uses its <sc>Sustains Damage</sc> ability, such as the <i>Direct Hit</i> or <i>Reflective Shielding</i> action cards, cannot be played.</li>
    <ol><li>The chosen ship may be repaired by the <i>Duranium Armor</i> technology later in the same round of combat.</li></ol>
    <li>If the Argent player plays the <i>Waylay</i> action card, hits in excess of their opponent&rsquo;s fighters will first cause chosen ships to become damaged, then those same hits must still be be assigned.</li>
    <ol><li>For example, say the opponent has three fighters and three dreadnoughts, undamaged. The Argent player plays <a>Waylay</a>, and rolls five hits. This allows them to cause two of the dreadnoughts to become damaged. The opponent then has to assign all five hits. The final dreadnought may use its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability to cancel one of those hits.</li></ol>
    <li>If the Argent player is in combat with the Nekro player, and the Nekro player has their mechs participating in the space combat via the effects of <i>The Alastor<i>, those mechs may become damaged by the effect of <sc>Raid Formation</sc>.</li>

    <ol class="note">
    <li>The planet with &ldquo;<sc>Production</sc> 1&rdquo; is considered to be on itself for the purposes of producing ground forces.</li>
    <li>A player with the <i>Light/Wave Deflector</i> technology cannot move their ships through systems containing the Argent player's structures, if the Argent player owns Aerie Hololattice.</li>

<h1>Strike Wing Alpha <sub>(Unit)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When a Strike Wing Alpha II rolls a 9 or 10, infantry are destroyed at the end of the <b>Roll Dice</b> step. This occurs before any ship may use its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability at the start of the <b>Assign Hits</b> step.</li>
    <li>Effects that cancel hits, such as the <i>Shields Holding</i> action card, cannot prevent the infantry from being destroyed. If an effects rerolls any anti&ndash;fighter barrage dice, the new result will determine how many infantry are destroyed.</li>
