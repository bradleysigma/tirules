<h1>Rules Reference</h1>
<style> .lrr > li:before, .lrr > h2 > li:before {content: '28.' counter(item, decimal);} </style>
<p>A deal is an agreement between two players that may or may not include a transaction that involves physical components.</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
    <li>Players can make deals with each other at any time, even if they are not neighbors. However, deals that include a transaction must follow the rules for transactions, including that the players be neighbors.</li>
    <li>Deals are binding or non&ndash;binding according to the conditions of the deal.</li>
    <li>If the terms of a deal can be resolved immediately, it is a binding deal. When a deal is binding, a player must adhere to the terms of the agreement and whatever transactions, if any, were agreed upon.</li>
    <ol><li>The results of playing an action card, including the act of successfully resolving a card, are not instantaneous and cannot be guaranteed. They cannot be part of a binding deal.</li></ol>
    <li>If the terms of a deal cannot be resolved immediately, it is a non&ndash;binding deal. When a deal is non&ndash;binding, a player does not have to adhere to any part of the agreement.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Notes</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>In general, only the terms of the deal that a player can immediately perform, even without the deal taking place, are binding. For example:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If a player has four resources available during the <b>Production</b> step of a tactical action, another player may give them four trade goods to on the condition that they produce a dreadnought during this <b>Production</b> step. As the active player could produce a dreadnought with the resources, this deal is binding.</li>
        <li>If instead the active player has zero resources available, the same deal would be non&ndash;binding.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>The following are further examples of non&ndash;binding deals:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Making a deal to use a promissory note in a specific way, before the promissory note has been transacted.</li>
        <li>Making a deal not make use of a unit&rsquo;s <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability during a tactical action, before ships have been moved.</li>
        <li>Making a deal to trade commodities in exchange for the active player to replenish another player&rsquo;s commodities during the resolution of the primary ability of the <i>Trade</i> strategic action.</li>
        <li>Making a deal for a player to vote on an agenda in a certain way, when it is not yet that player&rsquo;s opportunity to vote.</li>
        <li>Any deal that will resolve after dice are rolled.</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>
