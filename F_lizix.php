<h1>Assimilate</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Any space docks that are placed by this ability during a tactical action may produce units during the <b>Production</b> step of that tactical action.</li>
    <li>If the L1Z1X player resolves their <sc>Assimilate</sc> ability, and then plays the <i>Infiltrate</i> action card, or vice versa, they will replace zero PDS and space docks with zero PDS and space docks when they resolve the latter ability.</li>
    <li>If the L1Z1X player would have to place a structure, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they may remove a structure of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead.</li>
    <li>The L1Z1X player must mandatorily replace every structure. However, if there are none of that type in their reinforcements they are not forced to do so.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Harrow</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The <sc>Planetary Shield</sc> ability will prevent the use of the <sc>Harrow</sc> ability on a planet.</li>
    <li>The L1Z1X player cannot use their <sc>Harrow</sc> ability if they are not the active player. This will most commonly occur due to the effect of the N&rsquo;orr player&rsquo;s Commander.</li>
    <li>The L1Z1X player may use their <sc>Harrow</sc> ability at the end of the round in which their last ground force was destroyed. This may cause the combat to end in a draw.</li>
    <li>During the <b>Bombardment</b> step, each of the L1Z1X player&rsquo;s units with the <sc>Bombardment</sc> ability is assigned only one planet to bombard. However, during ground combat, every unit in the system with the <sc>Bombardment</sc> ability may use it against the planet the ground combat is taking place on.</li>
    <ol><li>An Annihilator may bombard when using <sc>Harrow</sc> if that mech is not currently participating in ground combat, even if it has been committed to a different planet, and has been or will be involved in another ground combat during the current invasion.</li></ol>
    <li>The L1Z1X player may use the ability of the X&ndash;89 Bacterial Weapon &Omega; technology card whenever they bombard.</li>
