<h1>Assimilate</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Any space docks that are placed by this ability during a tactical action may produce units during the <b>Production</b> step of that tactical action.</li>
    <li>If the L1Z1X player resolves their <sc>Assimilate</sc> ability, and then plays the <i>Infiltrate</i> action card, or vice versa, they will replace zero PDS and space docks with zero PDS and space docks when they resolve the latter ability.</li>
    <li>If the L1Z1X player wishes to place a structure, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they may remove a structure of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead.</li>
