    <li>Only one additional dice is rolled for each bombardment or space cannon roll, regardless of how many units are using that ability.</li>

<h1>Magen Defense Grid</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li><i>Magen Defense Grid</i> cannot be used if all of a player&rsquo;s units in combat that had the <sc>Planetary Shield</sc> ability have lost it.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Magen Defense Grid &Omega;</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The player with <i>Magen Defense Grid &Omega;</i> chooses which ground force the hit is assigned to.</li>
    <li>The chosen ground force may cancel the hit by using its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability, if present. A different ground force with the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability cannot do so.</li>
    <li>If the last of a player&rsquo;s ground forces in a ground combat are destroyed by the effect of <i>Magen Defense Grid &Omega;</i>, that player loses the combat immediately. They will be unable to use any &ldquo;start of combat&rdquo; abilities.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Self&ndash;Assembly Routines</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If multiple mechs are destroyed, the trade goods are gained one at a time.</li>
    <li>A mech cannot be placed in a space area with <i>Self&ndash;Assembly Routines</i>, and so cannot be placed in a system that does not contain a planet.</li>
    <li>If a player wishes to place a mech, but there are none left in their reinforcements, they may remove a mech from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead. The mech will be placed undamaged.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Duranium Armor</h1>

    </ol>

<h1>Assault Cannon</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A player with <i>Assault Cannon</i> must mandatorily resolve its ability if they meet the requirement.</li>
    <li>If a player loses ships before they can resolve the <i>Assault Cannon</i> ability, they will be unable to resolve it if they no longer have three or more non&ndash;fighter ships.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>This will most commonly happen when both players in a combat have <i>Assault Cannon</i>, and the defender has exactly three non&ndash;fighter ships.</li>
        <li>Examples of other abilities that may remove units at the start of a space combat include the Creuss player&rsquo;s <i>Dimensional Splicer</i> faction technology ability, the Mentak player&rsquo;s <sc>Ambush</sc> faction ability, the Yin player&rsquo;s <i>Impulse Core</i> faction technology ability, as well as abilities such as the <i>Courageous to the End</i> action card or the <i>Reflective Shielding</i> action card that may trigger off of any of the previous abilities.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>A player may use an ability to ships at the start of combat. If this brings the number of non&ndash;fighter ships to three or more, the player may then use the ability of <i>Assault Cannon</i>.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Each other player may use one ability after that player has gained ships, and before that player has the opportunity to use the <i>Assault Cannon</i> ability. This may prevent that player from using the ability, as above.
        <li>Examples of abilities that may add units at the start of space combat include a combination of the Mentak player&rsquo;s <i>Sleeper Cell</i> hero ability and their <sc>Ambush</sc> faction ability, the Nekro player&rsquo;s <i>Alastor</i> flagship ability and the Naaz&ndash;Rokha player&rsquo; <i>Eidolon</i> mech ability.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Effects that cancel hits, such as <sc>Sustain Damage</sc>, cannot be used to prevent ships from being destroyed.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Sarween Tools</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If units are produced without any unit using its <sc>Production</sc> ability, <i>Sarween Tools</i> will not provide a reduction to the cost.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Scanlink Drone Network</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The units must be on the planet before the <b>Movement</b> step of the tactical action.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Graviton Laser System</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    </ol>

<h1>Predictive Intelligence</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Neither ability of <i>Predictive Intelligence</i> may be used if it is exhausted.</li>
    <li>If a player removes any tokens from their fleet pool, they will need to meet their new fleet pool limits before any other effects may resolve.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Transit Diodes</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When resolving the ability of <i>Transit Diodes</i>, that player may remove ground forces from a system containing their command token.</li>
    <li>The ground forces may be removed from on a planet or from in a space area.</li>
    <li>The ground forces may be removed from different systems.</li>
    <li>The ground forces may be placed on different planets.</li>
    <li>If a mech is damaged when it is removed, it will remain damaged when it is placed.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Integrated Economy</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The produced units must be paid for.</li>
    <li>There is no limit on the number of units produced, so long as the combined cost does not exceed the planet&rsquo;s resource value.</li>
    <li>A player may produce ships with <i>Integrated Economy</i>, unless another player has ships in the space area of that planet&rsquo;s system.</li>
