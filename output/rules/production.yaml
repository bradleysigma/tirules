  rules:
    '68.1':
      rule: A unit’s Production ability, which is presented on a faction sheet or
        unit upgrade technology card, is always followed by a value. This value is
        the maximum number of units that this unit can produce.
      subrules:
        68.1.1:
          rule: If the active player has multiple units in the active system that
            have the Production ability, that player can produce a number of units
            up to the combined total of their units’ production values in that system.
        68.1.2:
          rule: When producing fighters or infantry, each individual unit counts toward
            the producing unit’s production limit.
        68.1.3:
          rule: A player can choose to produce one fighter or infantry instead of
            two, but must still pay the entire cost.
        68.1.4:
          rule: Production value from Arborec space docks cannot be used to produce
            infantry, even if the Arborec player controls other units that have Production
            in the same system.
    '68.2':
      rule: When a player produces ships by using Production that player must place
        them in the active system.
    '68.3':
      rule: When a player produces ground forces, that player must place those units
        on planets that contain a unit that used its Production ability.
    '68.4':
      rule: If a player uses the Production ability of a unit in a space area of a
        system to produce ground forces, those ground forces may either be placed
        on a planet the player controls in that system or in the space area of that
        system.
- name: Notes
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: A unit’s Production value is the maximum number of units that may be produced
        by that unit, regardless of cost. For example, a space dock with “Production
        6” could produce six dreadnoughts or six fighters.
    '2':
      rule: Placement of produced units is not limited by a unit’s Production value,
        only by the location of the producing units.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: For example, say a player is performing a tactical action on tile
            75. They have one Space Dock I each on Abaddon and Ashtroth, but not on
            Loki. They combine their production to place seven infantry. They could
            place all seven on Abaddon, all seven on Ashtroth, or split them. They
            cannot place any on Loki.
    '3':
      rule: If an effect allows a player to produce a ship of a specific type, then
        factional variations do not prevent that player from producing that type of
        ship.
