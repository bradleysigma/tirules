  rules:
    '10.1':
      rule: 'Step 1: Each player rolls dice for each of their units in the combat
        that has the Anti–Fighter Barrage ability; this is called an anti–fighter
        barrage roll. A hit is produced for each die roll that is equal to or greater
        than the unit’s Anti–Fighter Barrage value.'
      subrules:
        10.1.1:
          rule: A unit’s Anti–Fighter Barrage ability is presented along with a unit’s
            attributes on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards.
        10.1.2:
          rule: The Anti–Fighter Barrage ability is displayed as Anti–Fighter Barrage
            X (×Y). The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit,
            and Y is the number of dice rolled.
        10.1.3:
          rule: Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls
            do not affect anti–fighter barrage rolls.
        10.1.4:
          rule: This ability can still be used if no fighters are present; hits produced
            may be used to trigger specific abilities.
    '10.2':
      rule: 'Step 2: Each player must choose and destroy one of their fighters in
        the active system for each hit their opponent’s anti–fighter barrage roll
        produced.'
      subrules:
        10.2.1:
          rule: If a player has to assign more hits than they have fighters in the
            active system, the excess hits have no effect.
