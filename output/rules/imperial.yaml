  rules:
    '45.1':
      rule: During the action phase, if the active player has the Imperial strategy
        card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card’s primary ability.
    '45.2':
      rule: To resolve the primary ability on the Imperial strategy card, the active
        player can score one public objective of their choice if they meet that objective’s
        requirements as described on its card. Then, if the active player controls
        Mecatol Rex, they gain one victory point; if they do not control Mecatol Rex,
        they can draw one secret objective card.
    '45.3':
      rule: After the active player resolves the primary ability of the Imperial strategy
        card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active
        player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from their strategy
        pool to draw one secret objective card.
    '45.4':
      rule: If a player has more than three secret objective cards after drawing a
        secret objective, they must choose one of their unscored secret objectives
        and return it to the secret objective deck. This number includes the secret
        objective cards in the player’s hand and the cards that player has already
        scored. Then, they shuffle the secret objective deck.
