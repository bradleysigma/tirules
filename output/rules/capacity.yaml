  rules:
    '16.1':
      rule: A unit’s capacity value indicates the maximum combined number of fighters
        and ground forces that it can transport.
    '16.2':
      rule: The combined capacity values of a player’s ships in a system determine
        the number of fighters and ground forces that player can have in that system’s
        space area.
    '16.3':
      rule: If a player has more fighters and ground forces in the space area of a
        system than the total capacity of that player’s ships in that system, that
        player must remove the excess units.
      subrules:
        16.3.1:
          rule: A player can choose which of their excess units to remove.
        16.3.2:
          rule: Ground forces on planets do not count against capacity.
        16.3.3:
          rule: A player’s fighters and ground forces do not count against capacity
            during combat. At the end of combat, any excess units are removed and
            returned to that player’s reinforcements.
    '16.4':
      rule: Fighters and ground forces are not assigned to specific ships, except
        while they are being transported.

  rules:
    '1':
      rule: If a player moves more fighters and/or ground forces into a system containing
        another player’s ships, capacity limits must be met before proceeding to the
        Space Cannon Offense substep or the Space Combat step.
    '2':
      rule: If a ship with capacity is destroyed during the Space Cannon Offense step,
        capacity limits must be met before space combat starts.
    '3':
      rule: Capacity is checked after the winner of a space combat is determined.
        As such, it is possible to win a space combat with only fighters remaining,
        before removing those fighters due to lack of capacity.
    '4':
      rule: A ship cannot pick up more units from a planet than it has capacity. However,
        a ship may pick up any units (including zero) in a system as it transports,
        even if doing so would cause units to be removed due to capacity limits.
      subrules:
        '4.1':
          rule: 'For example, say a carrier (with capacity four) is in the space area
            of a system along with four fighters. On the only planet in that system
            are eight infantry. There are no other units in the system. When the carrier
            moves out of the system, it obeys the following:'
        '4.2':
          rule: The carrier may transport the four fighters, leaving behind all eight
            of the infantry in the system.
        '4.3':
          rule: The carrier may transport four of the eight infantry, leaving behind
            the four remaining infantry in the system. Now that the system has zero
            capacity, all four of the fighters will be removed.
        '4.4':
          rule: The carrier may transport two of the eight infantry and two of the
            four fighters, leaving behind the six remaining infantry in the system.
            Now that the system has zero capacity, the two remaining fighters will
            be removed.
        '4.5':
          rule: The carrier may transport nothing, leaving behind all eight of the
            infantry in the system. Now that the system has zero capacity, all four
            of the fighters will be removed.
        '4.6':
          rule: The carrier cannot attempt to pick up all eight infantry, even if
            it immediately removes four of them (and the fighters).
