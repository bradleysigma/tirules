    '2':
      rule: If the Creuss player has units or controls planets in a system with an
        alpha wormhole, and another player has units or controls planets in a system
        with a beta wormhole, or vice versa, then the Creuss player and that player
        are neighbors.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: The Mentak player may use their Pillage ability against the Creuss
            player in this manner.
    '3':
      rule: If Mecatol Rex contains an alpha wormhole, then the “For” effect of the
        Ixthian Artifact agenda will not affect the Creuss player’s units in a system
        with a beta wormhole (and no alpha wormhole), and vice versa.
    '4':
      rule: The Creuss player’s Quantum Entanglement ability applies to their units
        with the Deep Space Cannon ability. Other players cannot use Quantum Entanglement
        to produce hits from a unit with the Deep Space Cannon ability against the

        If received at the start of that player’s turn, that player may play it immediately.
      subrules:
        '1.1':
          rule: The active player may perform a transaction with each other player
            at most once per turn. As such, the active player cannot receive the Creuss
            IFF more than once per turn.
        '1.2':
          rule: If the active player received the Creuss IFF on a previous turn, they
            may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Creuss player
            to regain it. However, the Creuss IFF cannot be played twice in one timing
            window. The active player cannot play the Creuss IFF again until their
            next turn.
    '2':
      rule: Any deal between the Creuss player and another player regarding where
        the wormhole tokens will be placed, if made before the Creuss IFF is exchanged,

      rule: The Shields Holding action card may be used to cancel the hit.
    '5':
      rule: The chosen ship may cancel the hit by using its Sustain Damage ability,
        if present. A different ship with the Sustain Damage ability cannot do so.
      subrules:
        '5.1':
          rule: If the chosen ship does so, the Direct Hit and/or Reflective Shielding
            action cards may be used.

  rules:
    '1':
      rule: This ability is mandatory for the Creuss player in every status phase
        after it has been researched.
      subrules:
        '1.1':

- name: Hil Colish (Flagship)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: If the Hil Colish moves first, then the Creuss player uses the new position
        of the Hil Colish when determining if the active system may be reached by
        their other ships.
    '2':
      rule: If the Hil Colish moves last, then it may move itself into (or through,
        if its move value is increased) the Creuss Gate or Creuss home system. Before
        it does so, the Creuss player’s other ships may move through the wormhole
        created by the Hil Colish.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: The delta wormhole moves with the Hil Colish; it cannot move back
            to its origin system using its own delta wormhole.
    '3':
      rule: The Creuss player must declare all ships that will moving before they
        move the Hil Colish or their other ships. They then declare the path that
        the first ship(s) to move will travel along, and move those ship(s). They
        then declare the path that the other ship(s) to move will travel along, and
        move those ships. Any ships that were declared to move must, if it is possible
        to do so.
      subrules:
        '3.1':
          rule: If the Hil Colish is moved first, and is removed due to the effect
            of a gravity rift, other ships that were declared to move that can reach
            the destination system must do so, even if the path is through the gravity
            rift. Ships that cannot reach the active system do not move.
        '3.2':
          rule: The Creuss player cannot wait to see the result of their other ships’
            gravity rift rolls before deciding to move the Hil Colish; they must declare
            if the Hil Colish is moving at the same time they declare which other
            ships are moving.
    '4':
      rule: If the Hil Colish moves before or after other ships, it does not generate
        a second Space Cannon Offense step.
    '5':
      rule: A unit with the Deep Space Cannon ability may produce hits in systems
        adjacent to that unit via the delta wormhole in the Hil Colish’s system. Most
        commonly, this will allow the Creuss player to target units in the Hil Colish’s
        system from the space cannon rolls of units in their home system.
    '6':
      rule: If an effect allows another player to move through a system that contains
        the Creuss player’s ships (such as the Light/Wave Deflector technology), that
        player may move through the delta wormhole in the Hil Colish’s system.
    '7':
      rule: During space combat involving the Hil Colish, either player may retreat
        to another system containing a delta wormhole, if that system meets the other
        requirements for retreating.
      subrules:
        '7.1':
          rule: If the Hil Colish is destroyed between the Announce Retreats step
            and the Retreat step, then the retreating player must retreat to a different
            eligible system. If no such system exists, then their retreat is cancelled.
    '8':
      rule: When the Hil Colish retreats, it may retreat before or after the Creuss
        player’s other ships, but cannot retreat in such a way that would prevent
        the other ships from retreating to the same system.
- name: Emissary Taivra (Agent)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The Creuss player may use this ability to access the inactive wormhole
        nexus without a gamma wormhole. Moving ships into the wormhole nexus this
        way will cause it to flip.
    '2':
      rule: A delta wormhole in the system (such as from the Hil Colish) does not
        prevent this ability from being usable.
    '3':
      rule: If this ability is used, the active system will be adjacent to systems
        with delta wormholes.
    '4':
      rule: If a ship moves from the system containing the Ion Storm, it will not
        flip, unless the active player may move ships through the Ion Storm wormhole
        and chooses to do so.
    '5':
      rule: The system must have a non–delta wormhole in it at the moment of activation.
        If a wormhole is placed in a system with no other wormholes using the ability
        of an Icarus Drive, then Emissary Taivra cannot be used during the same activation.
      subrules:
        '5.1':
          rule: If a wormhole is placed at the start of a player’s turn in the system
            using the Creuss IFF, then Emissary Taivra may be used for the activation
            immediately following.
- name: Sai Seravus (Commander)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The fighters are placed one at a time, until either one has been placed
        for each ship with capacity that moved through a wormhole, or the capacity
        of the system is reached.
      subrules:
        '1.1':
          rule: The Creuss player cannot remove a ground force to create capacity
            for a fighter.
        '1.2':
          rule: The Creuss cannot place additional fighters once they have fighters
            and infantry in the space area equal to their capacity in that system,
            even if they have unused fleet pool and the fighter II unit upgrade technology.
        '1.3':
          rule: If the Creuss player has a space dock in the active system, they may
            consider some of the fighters they place as held by the space dock, in
            order to continue placing fighters.
    '2':
      rule: This ability may be used whenever the Creuss player’s ships move, not
        just during the movement step of a tactical action.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: If the Creuss player retreats from a combat, then they will have no
            capacity in the active system, and so cannot place any fighters there.
        '2.2':
          rule: If the Mahact player uses their Benediction hero ability to move the
            Creuss player’s ships, then the Creuss player may use this ability.
    '3':
      rule: A ship may move out of a system and back into the same system during tactical
        action movement, if its move value is high enough. If the Creuss player does
        this with a ship with capacity, and moves in this manner via a wormhole, they
        may place a fighter, if possible.
    '4':
      rule: When the Creuss player moves a ship through a wormhole, ending in a system
        that contains an alpha or beta wormhole and unlocks Sai Seravus, they cannot
        apply its ability to that movement.
      subrules:
        '4.1':
          rule: If the Creuss player moves the Hil Colish separately from other ships
            during the same Move Ships step, Sai Seravus cannot unlock until all movement
            is completed.
- name: Riftwalker Meian — Singularity Reactor (Hero)
  rules:
    '1':
      rule: Any units and tokens on either system are moved with their system.

  rules:
    '1':
      rule: The Icarus Drive does not have to be in the activated system.
    '2':
      rule: The wormhole token is placed in the system the Icarus Drive was in.
