            more than once per turn.
        '2.3':
          rule: If the active player received War Funding on a previous turn, they
            may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Letnev player
            to regain it. However, War Funding cannot be played twice in one timing
            window. The active player cannot play War Funding again until the next
            round of combat.

            to regain it. However, War Funding Ω cannot be played twice in one timing
            window. The active player cannot play War Funding again until the next
            round of combat.
        '1.4':
          rule: If the attacker receives War Funding Ω after the defender has played
            it, the attacker cannot play it during the same round of combat.

  rules:
    '1':
      rule: Non–Euclidean Shielding may be applied when a Dunlain Reaper uses its
        Sustain damage ability.

        hits produced by Bombardment and Space Cannon abilities.
    '3':
      rule: The Letnev player must cancel two hits whenever one of their units uses
        its Sustain damage ability; they cannot cancel just one.
    '4':
      rule: Say the Letnev player has exactly one hit produced against them remaining,
        and one of their units uses its Sustain damage ability to cancel it. If additional
        hits are produced against the Letnev player's units, such as with the Reflective
        Shielding action card, the Letnev player cannot retroactively use the previous
        use of Sustain damage to allow Non–Euclidean Shielding to cancel a second
        hit.

        they can unlock Rear Admiral Farran.
    '2':
      rule: This effect may be applied when a Dunlain Reaper uses its Sustain damage
        ability.
      subrules:
        '2.1':
          rule: If the Ul player has the Letnev player’s Alliance promissory note,
            then this effect may be applied when a Hel–Titan PDS uses its Sustain
            damage ability.
    '3':
      rule: A unit that becomes damaged without using its Sustain Damage ability will
        not trigger this effect.
    '4':
      rule: If multiple units use their Sustain Damage ability within a single step,
        the trade goods are gained one at a time.

    '2':
      rule: A Deploy ability may only be resolved for units in a player’s reinforcements.
        If all four Dunlain Reapers are already on the board, no Dunlain Reaper may
        be deployed.
      subrules:
