    <li>The Deepwrought player does not have the capability to prevent other players from using the ability of Aello.</li>
    <li>Aello cannot be used reduce a cost paid with trade goods, influence, or any other currency.</li> 
    <li>If a player has the Deepwrought player&rsquo;s <i>Alliance</i> promissory note, then other players may use the ability of either or both (or neither):</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Another player may use the ability from both for a two resource discount, triggering the commodity ability for both the Deepwrought player and the player with their <i>Alliance</i> promissory note.</li>
        <li>Another player may use the ability from only the Deepwrought player for a one resource discount, triggering the commodity ability for just the Deepwrought player.</li>
        <li>Another player may use the ability from only the player with the <i>Alliance</i> promissory note for a one resource discount, triggering the commodity ability for just the player with the <i>Alliance</i> promissory note.</li>
        <li>Another player may use the ability from neither player, and receive no discount; the commodity ability will trigger for neither the Deepwrought player nor the player with their <i>Alliance</i> promissory note.</li>
        <li>The Deepwrought player and the player with their <i>Alliance</i> promissory note may each use the ability of the other for a one resource discount, triggering the commodity ability for that other player.</li>
        <li>If the Mahact player has the Deepwrought player&rsquo;s command token in their fleet pool, then this gives each other player the option of another discount. The Deepwrought player, the player with their <i>Alliance</i> promissory note, and the Mahact player may choose up to two of the other players with the ability, triggering their commodity ability, and resulting in a corresponding discount of up to two resources. All other players may choose up to three of the players with the ability, triggering their commodity ability, and resulting in a corresponding discount of up to three resources.</li>

<h1>Visionaria Select <sub>(Breakthrough)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When <i>Visionaria Select</i> is exhausted, all other players have the opportunity to participate; the Deepwrought player does not choose which players will participate.</li>
    <li>The researching player chooses which promissory note they give to the Deepwrought player.</li>
    <li>Giving a promissory note because of <i>Visionaria Select</i> is not resolving a transaction.</li>
    <li>If the Deepwrought player already owns a technology that a participating player researches, then the Deepwrought player will not gain a technology.</li>
    <li>If the Nekro player participates, they will gain three command tokens. The Deepwrought player will not gain a technology this way.</li>
