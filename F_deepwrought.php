<h1>Aello <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Say a player is researching a technology, and they use the ability of Doctor Carrina, which results in the Deepwrought player placing their first ocean into play, unlocking Aello. Should this happen, then the researching player will be unable to use Aello to pay for the resource cost of the researched technology.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If this were to happen when the active player researches their first (zero resource cost) technology when resolving the primary ability of the <i>Technology</i> strategy card, they will be able to use Aello if/when they research their second (six resource cost) technology with that primary ability.</li>
        <li>If this were to happen when any player researches a technology when resolving the primary or secondary ability of the <i>Technology</i> strategy card, the other players clockwise of that player will be able to use Aello if/when they research a technology with the secondary ability. The player that used Doctor Carrina, and any players widdershins of them, will be unable to use Aello during this strategic action.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>The Deepwrought player does not have the capability to prevent other players from using the ability of Aello.</li>
    <li>Aello cannot be used reduce a cost paid with trade goods, influence, or any other currency.</li> 
    <li>If a player has the Deepwrought player&rsquo;s <i>Alliance</i> promissory note, then other players may use the ability of either or both (or neither):</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Another player may use the ability from both for a two resource discount, triggering the commodity ability for both the Deepwrought player and the player with their <i>Alliance</i> promissory note.</li>
        <li>Another player may use the ability from only the Deepwrought player for a one resource discount, triggering the commodity ability for just the Deepwrought player.</li>
        <li>Another player may use the ability from only the player with the <i>Alliance</i> promissory note for a one resource discount, triggering the commodity ability for just the player with the <i>Alliance</i> promissory note.</li>
        <li>Another player may use the ability from neither player, and receive no discount; the commodity ability will trigger for neither the Deepwrought player nor the player with their <i>Alliance</i> promissory note.</li>
        <li>The Deepwrought player and the player with their <i>Alliance</i> promissory note may each use the ability of the other for a one resource discount, triggering the commodity ability for that other player.</li>
        <li>If the Mahact player has the Deepwrought player&rsquo;s command token in their fleet pool, then this gives each other player the option of another discount. The Deepwrought player, the player with their <i>Alliance</i> promissory note, and the Mahact player may choose up to two of the other players with the ability, triggering their commodity ability, and resulting in a corresponding discount of up to two resources. All other players may choose up to three of the players with the ability, triggering their commodity ability, and resulting in a corresponding discount of up to three resources.</li>

    <li>If they also owned the purged technology, the Deepwrought player too will research another technology.</li>
    <li>If the Nekro player purges a technology, they will gain three command tokens instead of researching another technology.</li>

<h1>Visionaria Select <sub>(Breakthrough)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When <i>Visionaria Select</i> is exhausted, all other players have the opportunity to participate; the Deepwrought player does not choose which players will participate.</li>
    <li>The researching player chooses which promissory note they give to the Deepwrought player.</li>
    <li>Giving a promissory note because of <i>Visionaria Select</i> is not resolving a transaction.</li>
    <li>If the Deepwrought player already owns a technology that a participating player researches, then the Deepwrought player will not gain a technology.</li>
    <li>If the Nekro player participates, they will gain three command tokens. The Deepwrought player will not gain a technology this way.</li>
