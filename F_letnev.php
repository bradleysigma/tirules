    </ol>

<h1>Armada</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the Letnev player has zero command tokens in their fleet pool, they may still have ships on the game board. While this is the case, effects that remove command tokens from a player&rsquo;s fleet pool cannot affect the Letnev player.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>War Funding <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A player may play <i>War Funding</i> when the Letnev player has zero or one trade goods. The Letnev player will lose the single trade good, if applicable, and the other effects will resolve as normal.</li>

    <ol>
        <li>A transaction must involve the active player. As such, the defender will be unable to receive <i>War Funding</i>.</li>
        <li>The active player may perform a transaction with each other player at most once per turn. As such, the active player cannot receive <i>War Funding</i> more than once per turn.</li>
        <li>If the active player received <i>War Funding</i> on a previous turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Letnev player to regain it. However, <i>War Funding</i> cannot be played twice in one timing window. The active player cannot play <i>War Funding</i> again until the next round of combat.</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>

<h1>War Funding &Omega; <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A player may receive <i>War Funding &Omega; </i> in a transaction during a combat. If received at the start of a round, that player may play it immediately.</li>

    </ol>

<h1>L4 Disruptors <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">

    </ol>

<h1>Non&ndash;Euclidean Shielding <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li><i>Non&ndash;Euclidean Shielding</i> may be applied when a Dunlain Reaper uses its <sc>Sustain damage</sc> ability.</li>
    <li><i>Non&ndash;Euclidean Shielding</i> applies whenever hits are produced. This includes hits produced by <sc>Bombardment</sc> and <sc>Space Cannon</sc> abilities.</li>
    <li>The Letnev player must cancel two hits whenever one of their units uses its <sc>Sustain damage</sc> ability; they cannot cancel just one.</li>
    <li>Say the Letnev player has exactly one hit produced against them remaining, and one of their units uses its <sc>Sustain damage</sc> to cancel it. If additional hits are produced against the Letnev player's units, such as with the <i>Reflective Shielding</i> action card, the Letnev cannot retroactively use the previous use of <sc>Sustain damage</sc> to allow <i>Non&ndash;Euclidean Shielding</i> to cancel a second hit.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Arc Secundus <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The <i>Arc Secundus</i> is not repaired at the end of combat.</li>

    <ol class="note">
    <li>This effect may be applied when a Dunlain Reaper uses its <sc>Sustain damage</sc> ability.</li>
    <li>A unit that becomes damaged without using its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability will not trigger this effect.</li>
    <li>If multiple units use their <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability within a single step, the trade goods are gained one at a time.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Darktalon Treilla &mdash; Dark Matter Affinity <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">

    </ol>

<h1>Dunlain Reaper <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A <sc>Deploy</sc> ability may be resolved only once per timing window. As such, the Letnev player may only place one Dunlain Reaper this way per ground combat round.</li>
