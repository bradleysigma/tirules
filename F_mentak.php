<h1>Ambush</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect dice rolls made when resolving the <sc>Ambush</sc> ability.</li>
    <li>Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect dice rolls during combat can affect dice rolls made when resolving the <sc>Ambush</sc> ability. This is distinct from, and a superset of, combat rolls.</li>
    <li>If a cruiser or destroyer is removed before the Mentak player can resolve their <sc>Ambush</sc> ability, that ship cannot be one of the ships used when they do resolve their <sc>Ambush</sc> ability.</li>
    <li>The <i>Shields Holding</i> action card may be used to cancel the hit.</li>
    <li>A ship may cancel the hit by using its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability, if present.</li>
    <ol><li>If the chosen ship does so, the <i>Direct Hit</i> and/or <i>Reflective Shielding</i> action cards may be played.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Pillage</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>While the agenda phase and the Hacan player&rsquo;s <i>Trade Convoys</i> promissory note allow a player to resolve transactions with all other players, they do not make that player neighbors with the Mentak player.</li>
    <li>Effects that force players to give objects to other players are not transactions.</li>
    <li>If the Creuss player has units or controls planets in a system with an alpha wormhole, and the Mentak player has units or controls planets in a system with an beta wormhole, or vice versa, then the Creuss player and Mentak player are neighbors. The Mentak player may thus use their <sc>Pillage</sc> ability against the Creuss player.</li>
    <li>If the Winnu player owns <i>Lazax Gate Folding</i>, then the Mentak player may become neighbors with the Winnu player during the Winnu player&rsquo;s tactical action. If so, the Mentak player may use their <sc>Pillage</sc> ability during this time.</li>
    <li>If a player would gain multiple trade goods one at a time, the Mentak player can use their <sc>Pillage</sc> ability for each trade good.</li>
    <li>If a game effect instructs a player to convert their commodities to trade goods, that player does not gain any trade goods from that effect. The Mentak player cannot use their <sc>Pillage</sc> ability for those trade goods.</li>
    <li>The Mentak player may use their <sc>Pillage</sc> ability even if the transaction does not involve trade goods.</li>
    <li>The Mentak player may use their <sc>Pillage</sc> ability against both players involved in a transaction.</li>
    <li>If the Mentak player resolves a transaction with another player, they may then use their <sc>Pillage</sc> ability against that player.</li>
    <ol><li>The Mentak player does not decide to use their <sc>Pillage</sc> ability until after the transaction has been resolved. Any deal made to not use their <sc>Pillage</sc> ability before the transaction has been resolved is non&ndash;binding.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Promise of Protection <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the player with <i>Promise of Protection</i> in their play area resolves a transaction with another player, the Mentak player may still use their <sc>Pillage</sc> ability on that other player.</li>
    <li><i>Promise of Protection</i> has no effect while it is in a player&rsquo;s hand.</li>
    <li><i>Promise of Protection</i> is returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Mentak player this turn.</li>
    <li>Activating a system containing only the Mentak player&rsquo;s structures will still cause <i>Promise of Protection</i> to be returned.</li>
    <li>If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Mentak player&rsquo;s units (for example, the primary ability of the <i>Diplomacy</i> strategy card), this will not cause <i>Promise of Protection</i> to be returned.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Mirror Computing <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If an effect specifically requires that trade goods are spent (for example, the <i>Negotiate Trade Routes</i> objective), <i>Mirror Computing</i> does not increase the value of those trade goods.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Salvage Operations <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The produced unit must be paid for.</li>
    <li>If the space combat ends in a draw, <i>Salvage Operations</i> has no effect.</li>
    <li>If the Mentak player wishes to place a unit using their <i>Salvage Operations</i> ability, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they can remove a unit of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead.</li>
    <li>If the opponent has a faction specific ship, including their flagship, destroyed, the Mentak player may use their <i>Salvage Operations</i> to produce a generic ship of the same type, or their <i>Fourth Moon</i>, as appropriate.</li>
    <li>If a unit is only a ship for the opponent, the Mentak player cannot use their <i>Salvage Operations</i> to produce a unit of that type.</li>
    <li>The Mentak player cannot produce a war sun unless they have the war sun technology.</li>
    <li>The Mentak player cannot produce ground forces using <i>Salvage Operations</i>, even if their opponent has the ability to treat a ground force as a ship.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Fourth Moon <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    </ol>

<h1>Suffi An <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    </ol>

<h1>S&rsquo;ula Mentarion <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Mentak player&rsquo;s opponent chooses which promissory note they give to the Mentak player.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Ipswitch, Loose Cannon &mdash; Sleeper Cell <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Mentak player can trigger the <i>Sleeper Cell</i> ability, their <sc>Ambush</sc> ability, or any other &ldquo;at the start of a space combat&rdquo; abilities they have in any order.</li>
    <li>If ships are destroyed before the <i>Sleeper Cell</i> ability is triggered, the Mentak player cannot place those units.</li>
    <li>Fleet pool limits still apply during combat. However, if the Mentak is at their fleet pool limit, they may still place a unit using this ability, but must then immediately remove a unit.</li>
    <li>Capacity is not checked during combat. As such, the Mentak player may place an unlimited number of fighters into a combat with this ability.</li>
    <li>If all of the Mentak player&rsquo;s ships are destroyed, they may still place ships with this ability. If they do, combat will continue.</li>
    <li>No cost is paid for the placed unit.</li>
    <li>If the Mentak player wishes to place a unit with this ability, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they can remove a unit of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead.</li>
    <li>If the opponent has a faction specific ship, including their flagship, destroyed, the Mentak player may place a generic ship of the same type, or their <i>Fourth Moon</i>, as appropriate.</li>
    <li>If a destroyed unit is a ground force or structure, that the other player is treating as a ship due to some effect, the Mentak player cannot place that unit.</li>
    <li>The Mentak player cannot place a war sun unless they have the war sun technology.</li>
    <li>The opponent may still retreat during combat.</li>
