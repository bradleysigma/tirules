<h1>Stall Tactics</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    </ol>

<h1>Scheming</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>No other abilities may resolve until the Yssaril player has discarded the action card.</li>
    <li><sc>Scheming</sc> applies whenever the Yssaril player draws action cards.</li>
    <li>The Yssaril player will draw only one additional action card, regardless of how many action cards they are instructed to draw.</li>
    <li>The discarded action card may be any card in the Yssaril player&rsquo;s hand; it does not have to be one of the cards they just drew.</li>
    <li>Effects that give the Yssaril player action cards without drawing them, such as <i>The Codex</i> relic or the <i>Reverse Engineer</i> action card, will not trigger <sc>Scheming</sc>.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Crafty</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The effect of the <i>Executive Sanctions</i> law does not affect the Yssaril player.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Spy Net <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The player that plays <i>Spy Net</i> must look at the Yssaril player&rsquo;s hand of action cards. They do not have to read or memorize what they look at.</li>
    <li>A player may receive <i>Spy Net</i> in a transaction during their turn. If received at the start of that player&rsquo;s turn, that player may play it immediately.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The active player may perform a transaction with each other player at most once per turn. As such, the active player cannot receive <i>Spy Net</i> more than once per turn.</li>
        <li>If the active player received <i>Spy Net</i> on a previous turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Yssaril player to regain it. However, <i>Spy Net</i> cannot be played twice in one timing window. The active player cannot play <i>Spy Net</i> again until their next turn.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Any deal between the Yssaril player and another player regarding which action card will be chosen, if made before <i>Spy Net</i> is exchanged, is non&ndash;binding.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Mageon Implants <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When resolving <i>Mageon Implants</i>, the Yssaril player is not drawing a card. As such, <sc>Scheming</sc> will not trigger.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Transparasteel Plating <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Other players may resolve faction abilities, leader abilities or technology abilities during the Yssaril player&rsquo;s turns.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Y&rsquo;sia Y&rsquo;ssrila <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the Yssaril player owns the <i>Light/Wave Deflector</i> technology, it will have no additional effect on the <i>Y&rsquo;sia Y&rsquo;ssrila</i></li>
    </ol>

<h1>Ssruu <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the Yssaril player duplicates an agent that allows a unit to roll an additional die, and both the duplicated agent and Ssruu target the same unit, that unit will roll two additional dice.</li>
    <li>If the Yssaril player duplicates the Saar player&rsquo;s Captain Mendosa agent, they may do so before or after other effects are used to modify any ship&rsquo;s move value. This includes the Saar player&rsquo;s Captain Mendosa agent effect.</li>
    <li>If both the Yssaril player and the Vuil&rsquo;raith player wish to target the same player with the Vuil&rsquo;raith The Stillness of Stars agent ability, then they will both be able to capture a ship, resolving in initiative order from the active player. Both players will still use the target player&rsquo;s full commodity value to determine which units they may capture. Should the first player to resolve capture the last of a type of unit from the target player&rsquo;s reinforcements, the latter player cannot capture a unit of the same type.</li>
    <li>If the Yssaril player duplicates the Mentak player&rsquo;s Suffi An agent, then the Yssaril player and the player targeted by the Mentak player&rsquo;s <sc>Pillage</sc> ability will draw action cards. The Mentak player will not.</li>
    <li>Duplicating the effect of the Argent player&rsquo;s Trillossa Aun Mirik agent, the Creuss player&rsquo;s Emissary Taivra agent or the Jol&ndash;Nar player&rsquo;s Doctor Sucaban agent during the same timing window as that agent is used will have no additional effect.</li>
    <li>If either the Yssaril player or the Nomad player resolve the effect of the Nomad player&rsquo;s The Thundarian agent, the other will be unable to resolve the same effect immediately. They must wait until dice are rolled again before they may resolve the effect.</li>
    <li>For notes about an agent of a specific faction, see that faction&rsquo;s notes.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>So Ata <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Yssaril player cannot unlock So Ata if they are yet to discard a card for their <sc>Scheming</sc> ability.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Kyver, Blade and Key &mdash; Guild of Spies <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Each other player chooses which action card they show the Yssaril player.</li>
    <li>Taking action cards from a player using <i>Guild of Spies</i> will not trigger the Yssaril player&rsquo;s <sc>Scheming</sc> ability.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Blackshade Infiltrator <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
