<p>During the <b>Ground Combat</b> step of an invasion, if the active player has ground forces on a planet that contains another player&rsquo;s ground forces, those players resolve a ground combat on that planet. To resolve a ground combat, players perform the following steps:</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
	<li><b>Step 1 &ndash; Roll Dice</b>: Each player rolls one die for each ground force they have on the planet; this is a combat roll. If a unit&rsquo;s combat roll produces a result that is equal to or greater than that unit&rsquo;s combat value, that roll produces a hit.</li>
    <ol><li>If a unit&rsquo;s combat value contains two or more burst icons, the player rolls one die for each burst icon instead.</li></ol>
    <li><b>Step 2 &ndash; Assign Hits</b>: Each player in the combat must choose one of their own ground forces on the planet to be destroyed for each hit result their opponent produced.</li>
    <ol><li>When a unit is destroyed, the player who controls that unit removes it from the board and places it in their reinforcements.</li></ol>
    <li>After assigning hits, if both players still have ground forces on the planet, players resolve a new combat round starting with the <b>Roll Dice</b> step.</li>
    <li>Ground combat ends when only one player (or neither player) has ground forces on the planet.</li>
    <ol>
    	<li>During the first round of a combat, &ldquo;start of combat&rdquo; and &ldquo;start of combat round&rdquo; effects occur during the same timing window.</li>
        <li>During the last round of a combat, &ldquo;end of combat&rdquo; and &ldquo;end of combat round&rdquo; effects occur during the same timing window.</li>
        <li>After a combat ends, the player with one or more ground forces remaining on the planet is the winner of the combat; the other player is the loser of the combat.</li>
        <li>If neither player has a ground force remaining, there is no winner; the combat ends in a draw.</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Notes</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The &ldquo;start of combat&rdquo; and &ldquo;start of combat round&rdquo; occurs before the <b>Roll Dice</b> step.</li>
    <li>The &ldquo;end of combat&rdquo; and &ldquo;end of combat round&rdquo; occurs after the <b>Assign Hits</b> step.</li>
    <li>If ground combat is to happen on multiple planets during a single invasion step, they will be resolved planet by planet, after the <b>Space Cannon Defense</b> step has resolved been resolved on all planets and before the <b>Establish Control</b> step is resolved on any planet. The active player chooses the order combats are fought in.</li>
    <li>A player may score up to one secret objective per ground combat. If there is combat on multiple planets, a player may score a secret objective in each.</li>
    <li>A player may use the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability of a unit involved in a combat, usually a mech, to cancel a hit produced by their opponent.</li>
    <li>No player may retreat from a ground combat.</li>
    <li>The &ldquo;0&rdquo; side of the d10 represents a result of 10.</li>
