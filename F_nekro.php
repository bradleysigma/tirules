<h1>Galactic Threat</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Nekro player may still play rider action cards.</li>
    <li>If the Nekro player has the Xxcha player&rsquo;s <i>Alliance</i> promissory note, the Nekro player may vote, without losing their ability to predict outcomes for their <sc>Galactic Threat</sc> ability.</li>
    <li>If the speaker breaks a tie without casting any votes, then the speaker&rsquo;s technology are ineligible to be gained.</li>
    <ol><li>If no player casts votes, then no technology can be gained.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Technology Singularity</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the Nekro player gains a technology during a space combat, this does not prevent them from gaining technology during ground combats in the <b>Invasion</b> step of the same tactical action.</li>
    <li>If multiple ground combats happen on separate planets as part of a single <b>Invasion</b> step during one action, the Nekro player may gain a technology during each combat.</li>
    <li>Any method that destroys a unit during combat will trigger <sc>Technology Singularity</sc>, including an anti&ndash;fighter barrage roll, the <i>Direct Hit</i> action card, the Creuss player&rsquo;s <i>Dimensional Splicer</i> faction technology, etc.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>This includes any method used by the Nekro player&rsquo;s opponent that destroys their own units, usually as an ability cost.</li>
        <li>If a unit is removed, but not destroyed, that unit will not trigger the <sc>Technology Singularity</sc> ability.</li>
        <li>Space cannon and bombardment rolls happen outside of combat. Any hits produced cannot be used to trigger the <sc>Technology Singularity</sc> ability.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>If the Nekro player chooses to gain a unit upgrade technology, that upgrade will be in effect from that point in the combat onwards.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The combat value of a combat dice is fixed as it is rolled, and all combat dice are rolled before any hits are assigned. Gaining a unit upgrade technology will not cause any already rolled combat dice to produce any additional hits due to an improved combat value. The same applies to unit ability dice.</li>
        <li>Destroying an opponent&rsquo;s unit during the <b>Anti&ndash;Fighter Barrage</b> step, and gaining a unit upgrade technology will allow units of that type to use the abilities and attributes of the upgrade for the combat rolls of the same round.</li>
        <li>Destroying an opponent&rsquo;s unit at the start of a combat, such as with the ability of the <i>Assault Cannon</i> technology, and gaining a unit upgrade technology with an <sc>Anti&ndash;Fighter Barrage</sc> ability will allow units of that type to use that ability during the <b>Anti&ndash;Fighter Barrage</b> step of the first round of combat.</li>
        <li>If the Nekro player uses the <i>Direct Hit</i> action card to destroy a unit when it uses its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability, this will occur before any units are destroyed from being assigned hits. If the Nekro player then gains a technology that gives their units the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability, they may then use that ability for their units participating in the combat to cancel hits produced by their opponent during that round of combat.</li>
        <li>Players resolve abilities in initiative order, starting from the active player, until all players decline to resolve an ability consecutively; players who declined to resolve an ability previously may choose to resolve an ability if another player does so. While every player has the opportunity to resolve an ability, it is most common for only the two players involved in the combat to do so. Say the Nekro player does not have the Dreadnought II unit upgrade. If they use the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability of one of their dreadnoughts, then their opponent may destroy it with a <i>Direct Hit</i> action card. If the Nekro player does not use the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability (or any other ability within the same timing window), then their opponent may choose to use the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability of one of their units (or any other ability within the same timing window). If they do not, then the timing window advances, and no more units may use their <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> abilities to cancel any of the remaining hits. If the opponent does, however, use the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability of one of their units, the Nekro player may then destroy it with a <i>Direct Hit</i> action card, if it is an eligible target. After that, the Nekro player may choose to use the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability of one of their units, even if they had previously declined to do so; if they gained the Dreadnought II unit upgrade when they destroyed their opponent&rsquo;s non-dreadnought unit with the <i>Direct Hit</i> action card, then their opponent can no longer destroy the Nekro player&rsquo;s with their own <i>Direct Hit</i> action card.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>If the Nekro player destroys a unit, and gains a technology with an ability that is used during the same timing window, they may use that ability immediately.</li>
    <ol><li>For example, if the Nekro player uses the ability of the <i>Assault Cannon</i> technology at the start of a space combat to destroy a unit belonging to the Creuss player, and thus place a Valefar token on that player&rsquo;s <i>Dimensional Splicer</i> faction technology, the Nekro player may immediately use the ability of their Valefar <i>Dimensional Splicer</i> to produce a hit against one of the Creuss player&rsquo;s ships.</li></ol>
    <li>If the Nekro player gains the Infantry II unit upgrade from their <sc>Technology Singularity</sc> ability during a combat, any of the Nekro player&rsquo;s infantry destroyed at the same time as the unit used to trigger the <sc>Technology Singularity</sc> ability will be returned to their reinforcements.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If the Nekro player uses a <i>Direct Hit</i> action card to destroy an opponent&rsquo;s unit, and gain the Infantry II unit upgrade, then any infantry destroyed in that <b>Assign Hits</b> step will roll to be placed on the Infantry II card. This will most commonly occur if the Nekro player has infantry participating in space combat via the ability of their flagship, <i>The Alastor</i>.</li>
        <li>Any infantry destroyed by the Argent player&rsquo;s Strike Wing Alpha II faction unit ability are destroyed during the <b>Roll Dice</b> substep of the <b>Anti&ndash;Fighter Barrage</b> step. The Nekro player will not have the opportunity to gain the Infantry II unit upgrade until the <b>Assign Hits</b> substep immediately following, and so the destroyed infantry will be returned to their reinforcements.</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Propagation</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the Nekro player resolves an ability that instructs them to &ldquo;gain&rdquo; a technology, instead of &ldquo;research&rdquo; that technology, they will get that technology instead of the command tokens.</li>
    <li>The Nekro player may still resolve the primary or secondary abilities of the <i>Technology</i> strategy card, which will instead gain them command tokens.</li>
    <ol><li>The Nekro player may still benefit from owning the <i>Minister of Sciences</i> agenda card.</li></ol>
    <li>If an ability triggers &ldquo;when&rdquo; a player researches a technology, that ability will still be triggered by the Nekro player.</li>
    <ol><li>If the Nekro player owns <i>The Prophet&rsquo;s Tears</i> relic, they may draw an action card whenever they would research a technology.</li></ol>
    <li>If an ability triggers &ldquo;after&rdquo; a player researches a technology, that ability will never be triggered by the Nekro player.</li>
    <ol><li>If the <i>Anti&ndash;Intellectual Revolution</i> law is in play, the Nekro player will not destroy a ship when they would research a technology.</li></ol>
	<li>The Nekro player may play any action card that would allow them to research a technology, even if there is no viable technology that the Nekro player could have researched.</li>
    <ol><li>For example, the Nekro player may always play the <i>Reveal Prototype</i> action card at the start of combat, even if they would not meet the prerequisites of any of the unit upgrades for the units they have participating in the combat, and/or they already have the unit upgrades for each unit they have participating in the combat, and/or the units they have participating in the combat have no unit upgrade.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Antivirus <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The effect of <i>Antivirus</i> does not prevent the Nekro player gaining a technology from a player via their <sc>Galactic Threat</sc> ability.</li>
    <li>The player holding <i>Antivirus</i> may only play it at the start of a combat they are participating in.</li>
    <ol><li><i>Antivirus</i> may be played at the start of a combat that the Nekro player is not participating in.</li></ol>
    <li><i>Antivirus</i> has no effect while it is in a player&rsquo;s hand.</li>
    <li><i>Antivirus</i> is returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Nekro player this turn.</li>
    <li>Activating a system containing only the Nekro player&rsquo;s structures will still cause <i>Antivirus</i> to be returned.</li>
    <li>If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Nekro player&rsquo;s units (for example, the primary ability of the <i>Diplomacy</i> strategy card), this will not cause <i>Antivirus</i> to be returned.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Valefar Assimilator <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When copying another technology, each <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> retains its original text; it may later be used to copy a different faction technology.</li>
    <li>When copying another technology, <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> will retain its exhausted/readied state. It will not copy the target technology&rsquo;s exhausted/readied state.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The Nekro player may use any ability of the copied technology that does not require exhausting as a cost, even if the <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> card is exhausted.</li>
        <li>An exhausted <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> will always ready during the Status Phase, even if it is not currently copying a technology with an exhaust ability.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>If the Nekro player would copy a faction&ndash;specific unit upgrade, and they are already copying a faction&ndash;specific unit upgrade of the same type, they must use the same Valefar Assimilator token; they lose the previous faction unit upgrade.</li>
    <li>The Nekro player cannot copy faction&ndash;specific units that have not been upgraded.</li>
    <li>A faction&rsquo;s mech is not a technology. The Nekro player cannot use a <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> to copy a mech.</li>
    <li>If the Nekro player has a generic unit upgrade, and gains a faction&ndash;specific unit upgrade, then the faction&ndash;specific version will be in effect. If the faction&ndash;specific unit upgrade is later lost, they revert to the generic unit upgrade.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Owning two unit upgrades for the same type of unit in this manner only counts as one unit upgrade towards the <i>Develop Weaponry</i> and <i>Revolutionize Warfare</i> objectives.</li>
        <li>If the Nekro player gains a faction&ndash;specific infantry unit upgrade technology while they own the generic Infantry II unit upgrade technology and they have infantry on that unit upgrade card that would be placed in their home system at the start of their next turn, then those infantry are transferred to the <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> card that they are using to copy the faction&ndash;specific infantry unit upgrade.
    </ol>
    <li>If another player returns a technology which is currently being copied by a <i>Valefar Assimilator</i>, it will remain copied with a Valefar Assimilator token on it while in that player&rsquo;s technology deck.</li>
    <li>For the <i>Adapt New Strategies</i> objective, a <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> technology will count if and only if it is currently copying another technology.</li>
    <li>For notes about technologies of a specific faction, see that faction&rsquo;s notes.</li>
    <li>If the Nekro player has copied certain technology (possibly two or more at different points in time), the following apply:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If both the Saar player&rsquo;s Floating Factory II and the Vuil&rsquo;raith player&rsquo;s <i>Vortex</i> are copied, and another player blockades a Nekro space dock, the Nekro player returns any captured units, then destroys the blockaded space dock.</li>
        <li>If both the Letnev player&rsquo;s <i>Non&ndash;Euclidean Shielding</i> and the generic <i>Duranium Armor</i> technologies are copied, then a space combat between the Nekro player and the Letnev player in certain circumstances may result in neither player being able to win. If this happens, the attacker must declare a retreat. If the attacker cannot do so, they destroy all their units in that combat.</li>
        <li>If both the Muaat player&rsquo;s <i>Magmus Reactor</i> and the Saar player&rsquo;s Floating Factory II are copied, the Nekro player may move their space docks into supernovae.</li>
        <li>If the Saar player&rsquo;s Floating Factory II is copied, both the Nekro player and the Saar player may have their space docks in the same system, if there are no ships in that system.</li>
        <li>If the N&rsquo;orr player&rsquo;s Exotrireme II is copied, and the Nekro player is in a combat with the N&rsquo;orr player, then the players will alternate when resolving end of combat round abilities, starting with the active player (all players may resolve abilities in initiative order, but it is most common for only the two players involved in the combat to want to resolve abilities). For example, if the attacking player has two Exotriremes II in the system and the defender has four, assuming both players are hostile towards each other, the most likely sequence is as follows: The attacker activates one of their Exotriremes II, leaving them with one and the defender with two; The defender activates one of their Exotriremes II leaving them with one and the attacker with none.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>The Nekro player may lose a technology if they copy a new one. If they lose certain technologies, the following apply:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If the Saar player&rsquo;s Floating Factory II is lost, each space dock the Nekro player controls must be placed on a planet they control in the same system, or the space dock is removed.</li>
        <li>If the Muaat player&rsquo;s Prototype War Sun II is lost, and the Nekro player does not have the generic war sun technology, each of their war suns are removed from the game board.</li>
        <li>If the Muaat player&rsquo;s <i>Magmus Reactor</i> is lost, the Nekro player&rsquo;s units may remain in and move out of any supernovae they are currently in, but cannot move additional units into or through.</li>
        <li>If the Vuil&rsquo;raith player&rsquo;s Dimensional Tear II is lost, the dimensional tear tokens are removed from under the Nekro player&rsquo;s space docks; the systems are no longer gravity rifts (unless the system tile is a printed gravity rift).</li>
        <li>If a unit upgrade that provides that unit with the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability is lost, any damaged units will remain damaged, until either the status phase or another effect repairs them.</li>
        <li>The Nekro player may lose a faction&ndash;specific infantry unit upgrade technology, while they have infantry on the unit upgrade card that would be placed in their home system at the start of their next turn. If they are moving the Valefar Assimilator token to a different faction&ndash;specific infantry unit upgrade technology, the infantry remain on the <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> card. Else, if they own the generic Infantry II unit upgrade technology, the infantry are transferred to that unit upgrade card. Otherwise, the infantry are returned to the Nekro player&rsquo;s reinforcements.</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>

<h1>The Alastor <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Any effect that may target ships or non&ndash;fighter ships may target a ground force that is participating in space combat due to the effect of <i>The Alastor</i>.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>This includes counting towards the three non&ndash;fighter ships necessary to trigger the effect of the <i>Assault Cannon</i> technology.</li>
        <li>The Winnu player&rsquo;s flagship, the <i>Salai Sai Corian</i>, will roll one dice for each ground force the Nekro player has participating in a space combat via the effect of <i>The Alastor</i>.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>After the Nekro player uses the ability of <i>The Alastor</i>, all other players will have the opportunity to resolve an &ldquo;at the start of combat&rdquo; or an &ldquo;at the start of a round of combat&rdquo; ability before the Nekro player may resolve another ability.</li>
	<ol><li>For example, say the Nekro player owns the <i>Assault Cannon</i> technology, and uses the ability of <i>The Alastor</i> to bring the total number of non&ndash;fighter ships in the combat to three (or more). Other players may then resolve one ability each. If their opponent uses an ability that destroys ships, such as from their own <i>Assault Cannon</i>, to reduce the number of non&ndash;fighter ships the Nekro player has in the combat to two (or fewer), then the Nekro player will be unable to resolve the ability of their <i>Assault Cannon</i></li></ol>
    <li>Some abilities may destroy <i>The Alastor</i> at the start of a combat before the Nekro player has used its ability, such as the <i>Assault Cannon</i> technology.</li>
    <li>Ground forces on planets remain there while participating in combat. Effects that target units in a space area cannot target these ground forces.</li>
    <ol><li>When the Nekro player is in a space combat against the Argent player, their infantry on planets participating in the combat cannot be targeted by the ability of the Argent player&rsquo;s <i>Strike Wing Alpha II</i> destroyers.</li></ol>
    <li>If <i>The Alastor</i> is destroyed during space combat, any ground forces in that combat remain in that combat.</li>
    <li>If the Nekro player copies another player&rsquo;s flagship unit upgrade technology with one of their <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> technologies during a space combat, any ground forces in that combat remain in that combat. If the Nekro player starts the space combat copying another player&rsquo;s flagship unit upgrade technology, ground forces cannot participate in that combat, unless the Nekro player stops copying that flagship unit upgrade technology during the &ldquo;start of combat&rdquo; window.</li>
    <li>The ground forces in the space area during the combat still retain their ability to be transported. Since transported units do not count against capacity during combat, these ground forces will not count toward the Nekro player&rsquo;s fleet pool limit.</li>
    <li>A mech in the space combat may be targeted with the <i>Direct Hit</i> action card if it uses its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability.</li>
    <li>If the Nekro player has one of their <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> tokens on the Ul player&rsquo;s Hel Titan II faction unit upgrade technology, they may use <i>The Alastor</i> to have their PDS in the active system participate in the space combat.</li>
    <li>A ground force participating in a space combat may count towards scoring the <i>Demonstrate Your Power</i> secret objective.</li>
    <li>If the Nekro player loses their last ground force during a space combat and consequently meets the requirements for elimination, they are immediately eliminated. They will not be given the opportunity to score any objectives from winning the combat or destroying certain units at the same time their last ground force was destroyed.</li>
    <ol><li>If the Nekro player uses a <i>Direct Hit</i> action card to destroy an opponent&rsquo;s flagship, they may score the <i>Destroy their Greatest Ship</i> secret objective, even if there are some hits remaining that will cause the Nekro player to be eliminated once they are assigned. If this would bring the Nekro player to ten victory points, they will instead win the game before they are eliminated.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Nekro Malleon <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the chosen player is the Muaat player with their commander, Magmus, unlocked, they will gain a trade good from it if they spend a token from their strategy pool when resolving this ability.</li>
    <ol><li>That trade good will be gained separately from the other two.</li></ol>
    <li>The ability of Nekro Malleon cannot be resolved while another ability is resolving. For example, if the Nekro player is targeted by the <i>Spy</i> action card, they cannot use the ability of Nekro Malleon to discard one of their action cards before <i>Spy</i> resolves.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Nekro Acidos <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When the Nekro player gains their third technology and unlocks Nekro Acidos, they cannot apply Nekro Acidos to that instance of gaining a technology.</li>
    <li>When the Nekro places a Valefar Assimilator token on a technology, they are not gaining a technology.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>UNIT.DSGN.FLAYESH &mdash; Polymorphic Algorithm <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When the other player&rsquo;s units are destroyed, this does not trigger the Nekro player&rsquo;s <sc>Technology Singularity</sc> ability.</li>
    <li>Unit upgrades do not have a color. The Nekro player cannot gain a unit upgrade with <i>Polymorphic Algorithm</i>.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Mordred <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A Mordred will apply +2 against a player with both Valefar Assimilator tokens, and not +4.</li>
    </ol>
