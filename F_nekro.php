<h1>Galactic Threat</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Nekro player may still play rider action cards.</li>
    <li>If the Nekro player has the Xxcha player&rsquo;s <i>Alliance</i> promissory note, the Nekro player may vote, without losing their ability to predict outcomes for their <sc>Galactic Threat</sc> ability.</li>
    <li>If the speaker breaks a tie without casting any votes, then the speaker&rsquo;s technology are ineligible to be gained.</li>
    <ol><li>If no player casts votes, then no technology can be gained.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Technology Singularity</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the Nekro player gains a technology during a space combat, this does not prevent them from gaining technology during ground combats of the <b>Invasion</b> step of the same tactical action.</li>
    <li>If multiple ground combats happen on separate planets as part of a single <b>Invasion</b> step during one action, the Nekro player may gain a technology during each combat.</li>
    <li>Any method that destroys a unit during combat will trigger <sc>Technology Singularity</sc>, including an anti&ndash;fighter barrage roll, the <i>Direct Hit</i> action card, the Creuss player&rsquo;s <i>Dimensional Splicer</i> faction technology, etc.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>This includes any method used by the Nekro player&rsquo;s opponent that destroys their own units, usually as an ability cost.</li>
        <li>If a unit is removed, but not destroyed, that unit will not trigger the <sc>Technology Singularity</sc> ability.</li>
        <li>Space cannon and bombardment rolls happen outside of combat. Any hits produced cannot be used to trigger the <sc>Technology Singularity</sc> ability.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>If the Nekro player gains the Infantry II unit upgrade from their <sc>Technology Singularity</sc> ability during a combat, any of the Nekro player&rsquo;s infantry destroyed at the same time as the unit used to trigger the <sc>Technology Singularity</sc> ability will be returned to their reinforcements.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If the Nekro player uses a <i>Direct Hit</i> action card to destroy an opponent&rsquo;s unit, and gain the Infantry II unit upgrade, then any infantry destroyed in that <b>Assign Hits</b> step will roll to be placed on the Infantry II card.</li>
        <li>Any infantry destroyed by the Argent player&rsquo;s Strike Wing Alpha II faction unit ability are destroyed during the <b>Roll Dice</b> step. The Nekro player will not have the opportunity to gain the Infantry II unit upgrade until the <b>Assign Hits</b> step immediately following, and so the destroyed infantry will be returned to their reinforcements.</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Propagation</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Nekro player may still resolve the primary or secondary abilities of the <i>Technology</i> strategy card, which will instead gain them command tokens.</li>
    <li>The Nekro player may still use any abilities that trigger off of researching technologies, such as <i>The Prophet&rsquo;s Tears</i> relic.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Antivirus <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The effect of <i>Antivirus</i> does not prevent the Nekro player gaining a technology from a player via their <sc>Galactic Threat</sc> ability.</li>
    <li><i>Antivirus</i> has no effect while it is in a player&rsquo;s hand.</li>
    <li>Antivirus is returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Nekro player this turn.</li>
    <li>Activating a system containing only the Nekro player&rsquo;s structures will still cause <i>Antivirus</i> to be returned.</li>
    <li>If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Nekro player&rsquo;s units (for example, the primary ability of the <i>Diplomacy</i> strategy card), this will not cause <i>Antivirus</i> to be returned.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Valefar Assimilator <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When copying another technology, each <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> retains its original text; it may later be used to copy a different faction technology.</li>
    <li>When copying another technology <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> will retain its exhausted/readied state. It will not copy the target technology&rsquo;s exhausted/readied state.</li>
    <li>If the Nekro player would copy a faction&ndash;specific unit upgrade, and they are already copying a faction&ndash;specific unit upgrade of the same type, they must use the same Valefar Assimilator token; they lose the previous faction unit upgrade.</li>
    <li>The Nekro player cannot copy faction&ndash;specific units that have not been upgraded.</li>
    <li>A faction&rsquo;s mech is not a technology. The Nekro player cannot use a <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> to copy a mech.</li>
    <li>If the Nekro player has a generic unit upgrade, and gains a faction&ndash;specific unit upgrade, then the faction&ndash;specific version will be in effect. If the faction&ndash;specific unit upgrade is later lost, they revert to the generic unit upgrade.</li>
    <ol><li>Owning two unit upgrades for the same type of unit in this manner only counts as one unit upgrade towards the <i>Develop Weaponry</i> and <i>Revolutionize Warfare</i> objectives.</li></ol>
    <li>If another player returns a technology which is currently being copied by a <i>Valefar Assimilator</i>, it will remain copied with a <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> token on it while in that player&rsquo;s technology deck.</li>
    <li>For the <i>Adapt New Strategies</i> objective, a <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> technology will count if and only if it is currently copying another technology.</li>
    <li>For notes about technologies of a specific faction, see that faction&rsquo;s notes.</li>
    <li>If the Nekro player has copied certain technology (possible two or more at different points in time), the following apply:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If both the Saar player&rsquo;s Floating Factory II and the Vuil&rsquo;raith player&rsquo;s <i>Vortex</i> are copied, and another player blockades a Nekro space dock, the Nekro player returns any captured units, then destroys the blockaded space dock.</li>
        <li>If both the Letnev player&rsquo;s <i>Non&ndash;Euclidean Shielding</i> and the generic <i>Duranium Armor</i> technologies are copied, then a space combat between the Nekro player and the Letnev player in certain circumstances may result in neither player being able to win. If this happens, the attacker must declare a retreat. If the attacker cannot do so, they destroy all their units in that combat.</li>
        <li>If both the Muaat player&rsquo;s <i>Magmus Reactor</i> and the Saar player&rsquo;s Floating Factory II are copied, the Nekro player may move their space docks into supernovae.</li>
        <li>If the Saar player&rsquo;s Floating Factory II is owned, both the Nekro player and the Saar player may have their space docks in the same system, if there are no ships in that system.</li>
        <li>If the N&rsquo;orr player&rsquo;s Exotrireme II is copied, and the Nekro player is in a combat with the N&rsquo;orr player, then the two players will alternate when resolving end of combat round abilities, starting with the attacker. If the attacking player has two Exotrireme II in the system and the defender has four, assuming both players are hostile towards each other, the most likely sequence is as follows: The attacker activates one of their Exotrireme II, leaving them with one and the defender with two; The defender activates one of their Exotrireme II leaving them with one and the attacker with none.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>The Nekro player may lose a technology if they copy a new one. If they lose certain technologies, the following apply:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If the Saar player&rsquo;s Floating Factory II is lost, each space dock the Nekro player controls must be placed on a planet they control in the same system, or the space dock is removed.</li>
        <li>If the Muaat player&rsquo;s Prototype War Sun II is lost, and the Nekro player does not have the generic war sun technology, each of their war suns are removed from the game board.</li>
        <li>If the Muaat player&rsquo;s <i>Magmus Reactor</i> is lost, the Nekro player&rsquo;s units may remain in and move out of any supernovae they are currently in, but cannot move additional units into or through.</li>
        <li>If the Vuil&rsquo;raith player&rsquo;s Dimensional Tear II is lost, the dimensional tear tokens are removed from under the Nekro player&rsquo;s space docks.</li>
        <li>If a unit upgrade that provides that unit with the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability is lost, any damaged units will remain damaged, until either the status phase or another effect repairs them.</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>

<h1>The Alastor <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Any effect that may target ships or non&ndash;fighter ships may target a ground force that is participating in space combat due to the effect of <i>The Alastor</i>.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>This includes counting towards the three non&ndash;fighter ships necessary to trigger the effect of the <i>Assault Cannon</i> technology.</li>
        <li>The Winnu player&rsquo;s <i>Salai Sai Corian</i> flagship will roll one dice for each ground force the Nekro player has participating in a space combat via the effect of <i>The Alastor</i>.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>After the Nekro player uses the ability of <i>The Alastor</i>, all other players will have the opportunity to resolve an &ldquo;at the start of combat&rdquo; or an &ldquo;at the start of a round of combat&rdquo; ability before the Nekro player may resolve another ability.</li>
	<ol><li>For example, say the Nekro player owns the <i>Assault Cannon</i> technology, and uses the ability of <i>The Alastor</i> to bring the total number of non&ndash;fighter ships in the combat to three (or more). Other players may then resolve one ability each. If their opponent uses an ability that destroys ships, such as from their own <i>Assault Cannon</i>, to reduce the number of non&ndash;fighter ships the Nekro player has in the combat to two (or fewer), then the Nekro player will be unable to resolve the ability of their <i>Assault Cannon</i></li></ol>
    <li>Some abilities may destroy <i>The Alastor</i> at the start of a combat before the Nekro player has used its ability, such as the <i>Assault Cannon</i> technology.</li>
    <li>Ground forces on planets remain there while participating in combat. Effects that target units in a space area cannot target these ground forces.</li>
    <li>If <i>The Alastor</i> is destroyed during space combat, any ground forces in that combat remain in that combat.</li>
    <li>If the Nekro player copies another player&rsquo;s flagship unit upgrade technology with one of their <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> technologies during a space combat, any ground forces in that combat remain in that combat. If the Nekro player starts the space combat copying another player&rsquo;s flagship unit upgrade technology, ground forces cannot participate in that combat, unless the Nekro player stops copying that flagship unit upgrade technology during the &ldquo;start of combat&rdquo; window.</li>
    <li>The ground forces in the combat still retain their ability to be transported. Since transported units do not count against capacity during combat, these ground forces will not count toward the Nekro player&rsquo;s fleet pool limit.</li>
    <li>A mech in the space combat may be targeted with the <i>Direct Hit</i> action card if it uses its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability.</li>
    <li>If the Nekro player has one of their <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> tokens on the Ul player&rsquo;s Hel Titan II faction unit upgrade technology, they may use <i>The Alastor</i> to have their PDS in the active system participate in the space combat.</li>
    <li>All ground forces will leave the space combat before the Nekro player has the opportunity to score the <i>Demonstrate Your Power</i> secret objective; they will not count towards the three non&ndash;fighter ships.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Nekro Malleon <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the chosen player is the Muaat player with their commander unlocked, they will gain a trade good from it if they spend a token from their strategy pool when resolving this ability.</li>
    <ol><li>That trade good will be gained separately from the other two.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Nekro Acidos <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When the Nekro player gains their third technology and unlocks Nekro Acidos, they cannot apply Nekro Acidos to that instance of gaining a technology.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>UNIT.DSGN.FLAYESH &mdash; Polymorphic Algorithm <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When the other player&rsquo;s units are destroyed, this does not trigger the Nekro player&rsquo;s <sc>Technology Singularity</sc> ability.</li>
    <li>Unit upgrades do not have a color. The Nekro player cannot gain a unit upgrade with <i>Polymorphic Algorithm</i>.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Mordred <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A Mordred will not apply +4 to a player with both Valefar Assimilator tokens.</li>
    </ol>
