<p>A space dock is a structure that allows players to produce units.</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
    <li>Each space dock has a <sc>Production</sc> ability that indicates the number of units it can produce.</li>
    <li>The primary way in which players acquire space docks is by resolving either the primary or secondary abilities of the <i>Construction</i> strategy card.</li>
    <li>Space docks are placed on planets. Each planet can have a maximum of <b>one</b> space dock.</li>
    <li>If a player&rsquo;s space dock is ever on a planet that does not contain any of their ground forces and contains a unit that belongs to another player, that space dock is destroyed.</li>
    <ol><li>The Clan of Saar&rsquo;s <i>Floating Factory</i> faction&ndash;specific space dock is destroyed when it is blockaded; that is to say, when it is in a system with another player&rsquo;s ships and none of the Clan of Saar&rsquo;s ships.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Notes</h1>
    <ol class="note">
