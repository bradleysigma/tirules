<h1>Rules Reference</h1>
<style> .lrr > li:before, .lrr > h2 > li:before {content: '23.' counter(item, decimal);} </style>
<p>If a component type is depleted during the game, players obey the following rules:</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
    <li>Dice: Dice are limitless. If a player needs to roll more dice than the game provides, that player should roll as many as possible, record the results, and then reroll dice as necessary.</li>
    <li>Tokens: Tokens are limited to those included in the game, except for the following:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Control Tokens</li>
        <li>Fighter Tokens</li>
        <li>Trade Good Tokens</li>
        <li>Infantry Tokens</li>
    </ul>
    <li>If any of the above tokens are depleted, players can use a suitable substitute, such as a coin or bead.</li>
    <li>Units: Units are limited to those included in the game, except for fighters and ground forces.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>When a player would place a unit, if there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, that player can remove a unit from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that unit in their reinforcements. A player can remove any number of their units in this way; however, any units that are removed must be placed immediately. Abilities cannot force a player to remove and place a unit in this manner.</li>
        <li>When producing a fighter or infantry unit, a player can use a fighter or infantry token, as appropriate, from the supply instead of a plastic piece. These tokens must be accompanied by at least one plastic piece of the same type; players can swap infantry and fighter tokens for plastic pieces at any time.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Cards: When a deck is depleted, players shuffle the deck&rsquo;s discard pile and place it facedown to create a new deck.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Notes</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>As each player only has ten plastic fighter figures and twelve plastic infantry figures, a player cannot have fighters in more than ten systems, and cannot have infantry on more than twelve planets or being carried in more than twelve space areas, or any combination thereof.</li>
    <li>Players may also swap infantry and fighter plastic pieces for tokens at any time.</li>
    <li>Players may swap between three value tokens and one value tokens as desired.</li>
    <li>A player may only resolve a deploy ability to place a unit that is in their reinforcements. A player cannot remove a unit from the board to use its deploy ability.</li>
    <li>Each faction has sixteen command and seventeen control tokens included in the game.</li>
    <li>When a discard pile is shuffled to form a new deck, any cards that have been purged are not included.</li>
    </ol>
