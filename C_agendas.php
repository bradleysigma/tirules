    <ol><li>Players may still play riders if only one secret objective is in play.</li></ol>
    <li>The player that originally owned the secret objective elected by <i>Classified Document Leaks</i> cannot score it again after it becomes a public objective.</li>
    <li>The elected secret objective no longer counts towards the original player&rsquo;s limit of three secret objectives.</li>

    <li>A player can score a maximum of one objective of any type during or after each combat. A player cannot score the elected objective and one of their own secret objectives from the same combat.</li>
    <li>The elected objective becomes a public objective and stops being a secret objective.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If <i>Classified Document Leaks</i> is elected by <i>Miscount Disclosed</i>, the objective that was originally elected will remain a public objective during the vote. It therefore cannot be re&ndash;elected.</li>
        <li>If there are no other secret objectives eligable to be elected by the <i>Miscount Disclosed</i> revote, <i>Classified Document Leaks</i> will be discarded, and another agenda will be revealed and voted on.</li>

    <li>The <i>Confusing Legal Text</i> and <i>Confounding Legal Text</i> action cards may be played after <i>Committee Formation</i> has been discarded to change who the elected player is, which will negate the effects of <i>Committee Formation</i>.</li>
    <ol><li>The <i>Deadly Plot</i> action card may be played after <i>Committee Formation</i> has been discarded to discard the agenda without resolving it, but only if that player predicted a different outcome from some other game effect.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Compensated Disarmament</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>All trade goods are gained together.</li>

    <li>Any effects that take place when or after an agenda is revealed instead take place when or after the speaker has drawn and announced the possible outcomes for the hidden agenda.</li>
    <li>If an effect, such as the <i>Veto</i> action card, would discard <i>Covert Legislation</i>, both it and the hidden agenda are discarded.</li>
    <li>The hidden agenda is only revealed as it is resolved. All abilities that may be played after voting, such as the <i>Bribery</i>, <i>Confounding Legal Text</i>, <i>Confusing Legal Text</i> or <i>Deadly Plot</i> action cards, must be played before the agenda is revealed.</li>
