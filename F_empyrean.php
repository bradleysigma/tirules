<h1>Voidborn</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>This effect also applies outside the <b>Movement</b> step.</li>
    <li>The Empyrean player treats nebulae as nebulae and as anomalies for all other game purposes.</li>
    <ol><li>When the Empyrean player is the defender during a space combat in a nebula, they will receive the +1 to their combat rolls.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Aetherpassage</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Empyrean player does not decide to use this ability until after the other player has activated a system. Any deal made to use this ability before the system has been activated is non&ndash;binding.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Blood Pact <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Both players must cast at least one vote to trigger the additional votes.</li>
    <ol><li>If either player cannot vote on an agenda, then the additional votes will not trigger for that agenda.</li></ol>
    <li><i>Blood Pact</i> has no effect while it is in a player&rsquo;s hand.</li>
    <li><i>Blood Pact</i> is returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Empyrean player this turn.</li>
    <li>Activating a system containing only the Empyrean player&rsquo;s structures will still cause <i>Blood Pact</i> to be returned.</li>
    <li>If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Empyrean player&rsquo;s units (for example, the primary ability of the <i>Diplomacy</i> strategy card), this will not cause <i>Blood Pact</i> to be returned.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Dark Pact <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A player cannot have more commodities than their commodity value.</li>
    <li>If the Empyrean player plays a player&rsquo;s <i>Trade Agreement</i> promissory note, this will count for that player giving the Empyrean player all their commodities.</li>
    <li>The trade goods are not gained until after the transaction between the two players is resolved. As a pair of players is limited to one transaction per turn (which must involve the active player) or per agenda, the two players cannot then perform a transaction for these trade goods on the same turn.</li>
    <li><i>Dark Pact</i> has no effect while it is in a player&rsquo;s hand.</li>
    <li><i>Dark Pact</i> is returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Empyrean player this turn.</li>
    <li>Activating a system containing only the Empyrean player&rsquo;s structures will still cause <i>Dark Pact</i> to be returned.</li>
    <li>If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Empyrean player&rsquo;s units (for example, the primary ability of the <i>Diplomacy</i> strategy card), this will not cause <i>Dark Pact</i> to be returned.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Aetherstream <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Empyrean player does not decide to use this ability until after the other player has activated a system. Any deal made to use this ability before the system has been activated is non&ndash;binding.</li>
    <li>A system is not adjacent to itself. If a system with an anomaly is activated, <i>Aetherstream</i> will not give any ships +1 to their move value, unless that system is adjacent to another anomaly.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Voidwatch <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The active player chooses which promissory note they give the Empyrean player.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Dynamo <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A unit may only use its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability once in each <b>Assign Hits</b> step, even if it is repaired.</li>
    <li>A unit that becomes damaged without using its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability will not trigger this effect.</li>
    <li>A player may play a <i>Direct Hit</i> action card during the same timing window as this ability. If they do so, the ship is destroyed.</li>
    <li>Each unit using its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability creates a separate timing window. As such, any excess influence used to repair a ship is wasted, and cannot be used to repair a different ship.</li>
    <ol><li>As an example, The Dark may be exhausted to repair only one ship, not two.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Acamar <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Exhausting Acamar is a cost. The <i>Acamar</i> agent&rsquo;s ability cannot be used if it is exhausted.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Xuange <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>While the agenda phase and the Hacan player&rsquo;s <i>Trade Convoys</i> promissory note allow a player to resolve transactions with all other players, they do not make that player neighbors with all other players.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Conservator Procyon &mdash; Multiverse Shift <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Empyrean player chooses the order of exploration.</li>
    <li>A system that contains a planet destroyed by the <i>Stellar Converter</i> relic, and no other planets, is considered empty.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Watcher <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>This effect may cancel a <i>Sabotage</i> action card.</li>
