<h1>Unrelenting</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li><sc>Unrelenting</sc> does not affect anti&ndash;fighter barrage, bombardment or space cannon rolls.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Tekklar Legion <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li><i>Tekklar Legion</i> does not affect anti&ndash;fighter barrage, bombardment or space cannon rolls.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Valkyrie Particle Weave <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The hit produced by <i>Valkyrie Particle Weave</i> is added to any other hits produced in the immediately preceding <b>Roll Dice</b> step.</li>
    <li>The N&rsquo;orr player producing zero hits with their combat roll will not prevent <i>Valkyrie Particle Weave</i> from producing an additional hit.</li>
    <li>If the opponent produces a hit, <i>Valkyrie Particle Weave</i> mandatorily produces a hit.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Exotrireme <sub>(Unit)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When resolving the ability of an Exotrireme II, the N&rsquo;orr player chooses which ships are destroyed.</li>
    <ol><li>The N&rsquo;orr cannot choose their own ships as targets.</li></ol>
    <li>Effects that cancel hits, such as the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability, cannot be used to prevent ships from being destroyed.</li>
    <li>If a player retreats, the N&rsquo;orr player will be unable to use the ability of an Exotrireme II to destroy an opponent&rsquo;s ship.</li>
    <li>If the N&rsquo;orr player is in a combat with the Yin player, then the two players will alternate when resolving end of combat round abilities, starting with the attacker.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>C&rsquo;morran N&rsquo;orr <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li><i>C&rsquo;morran N&rsquo;orr</i> does not affect anti&ndash;fighter barrage, bombardment or space cannon rolls.</li>

<h1>T&rsquo;ro <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    </ol>

<h1>G&rsquo;hom Sek&rsquo;kus <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>This ability allows the N&rsquo;orr player to commit ground forces to a planet even if they have no ships in the active system.</li>
    <li>The <i>Parley</i> action card will place the committed ground forces in the space area of the active system. If the N&rsquo;orr player does not have enough capacity in the space area for the extra ground forces, including zero capacity, they will have to remove fighters and ground forces to meet capacity limits.</li>
    <li>Only the active player may use the <sc>Bombardment</sc> ability of their units during an invasion. As such, any ships in the active system will be unable to use their <sc>Bombardment</sc> ability ability unless they belong to the N&rsquo;orr player.</li>
    <ol><li>This prevents the L1Z1X player from using their <sc>Harrow</sc> faction ability, unless they have the N&rsquo;orr <i>Alliance</i> promissory note and they are the active player.</li></ol>
    <li>Another player may still produce hits against the N&rsquo;orr player&rsquo;s ground forces committed using G&rsquo;hom Sek&rsquo;kus during the <b>Space Cannon Defense</b> step.</li>
    <li>Effects that prevent or affect movement, such as the N&rsquo;orr player&rsquo;s <i>Ceasefire</i> promissory note or anomalies, do not prevent ground forces from being committed.</li>
    <li>The N&rsquo;orr player may use this ability to commit ground forces to any planet in the active system, regardless of who, if anyone, controls it.</li>
    <li>The <b>Commit Ground Forces</b> step is entirely resolved before the <b>Establish Control</b> step (with other steps between). When the N&rsquo;orr player gains control of their fifth non&ndash;home system planet, an unlocks G&rsquo;hom Sek&rsquo;kus, they cannot then use G&rsquo;hom Sek&rsquo;kus to commit additional ground forces during that tactical action.</li>
    <li>Ground forces cannot be committed to a planet if it has the <i>Demilitarized Zone</i> exploration card attached.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Sh&rsquo;val, Harbinger &mdash; Tekklar Conditioning <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The <i>Parley</i> action card will place the committed ground forces in the space area of the active system. As the N&rsquo;orr player will not have enough capacity in the space area for their ground forces, they will have to remove all ground forces from that planet now in the space area of that system.</li>
    <li>The <b>Space Cannon Offense</b>, <b>Space Combat</b> and <b>Bombardment</b> steps are skipped.</li>
    <li>Another player may still produce hits against the N&rsquo;orr player&rsquo;s ground forces committed using <i>Tekklar Conditioning</i> during the <b>Space Cannon Defense</b> step.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Valkyrie Exoskeleton <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The hit produced by the Valkyrie Exoskeleton is added to any other hits produced in the immediately preceding <b>Roll Dice</b> step.</li>
    <li>If a Valkyrie Exoskeleton uses its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability during a ground combat, it mandatorily produces a hit.</li>
    </ol>
