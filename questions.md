# Mechanics

## Capture
- A player cannot place (or produce) a unit captured by another player. Can a player place their own captured unit without being explicitly instructed to do so?

## Coexistence
- Can a player score public objectives if they coexist in their own home system?
- Say a player is fighting a ground combat against a planet's owner, and will then fight another player who is coexisting. Who controls the planet after the first ground combat?
- Are coexisting non-structure units with PRODUCTION blockaded?
- If the controller of a planet removes all of their units from it, and two or more other players are coexisting, which player gains control of that planet?
- BOMBARDMENT rolls are made against each player coexisting individually. Does this allow _Plasma Scoring_ etc. to trigger multiple times?
- Can a player score _Stake Your Claim_ by coexisting on a planet in a single planet system?
- Can a player explore a planet they are coexisting on? If so, can hazardous exploration cards be resolved with another player's mech and/or infantry? And can the planet be readied by the coexisting player?

## Combat
- What happens if a player has only fighters when they would retreat (either from being _Rout_'d when they only have fighters, or losing a bigger ship after announcing retreats, maybe because of _Direct Hit_)? Do they just instantly remove all the fighters and lose the combat, or is the retreat cancelled and they go to the next round of combat?
- What about Nekro if they only have ground forces located on planets remaining in the fight (having started the combat with the Alastor)?
- If a game effect says "hits ... must be assigned to non-fighter ships if able" (such as the L1Z1X flagship or _Graviton Laser System_), how literal is the word "must"? In particular, can those hits be cancelled (if they're cancelled, then they're not being assigned to non-fighter ships)?

## Command Tokens
- What happens if a player (probably Letnev) has all sixteen command tokens on the game board, and they want to retreat? What about Diplomacy?
- I recall a discussion regarding abilities that spend command tokens from reinforcements (NRA hero, _Scepter of Emelpar_, etc.). Specifically, updating the ruling requiring using a command token from the command sheet if a player had no tokens in their reinforcements, even if the spent token would be returned to reinforcements. Will this ruling be updated to allow spending a phantom token instead?

## Entropic Scar
- Can Creuss use _Wormhole Generator_ when an entropic scar is present to remove a wormhole token from the game board?
- The exploration cards that place gamma wormholes are usually purged after they are resolved. If they would place a gamma wormhole in an entropic scar, are these cards purged or discarded?
- Similar question for the _Ion Storm_ exploration card?
- What happens to the _Hil Colish_ delta wormhole in the entropic scar?
- If a player has ships in two different entropic scars, can they spend two tokens to gain both faction technologies during the status phase?

## Expedition
- What happens in the rare situation that, when Thunder's Edge is due to be placed, every system a) contains planets, b) contains a printed wormhole, c) is a supernova and/or d) is in The Fracture?
- Can Thunder's Edge be placed in the system that contains the remains of a _Stellar Converter_'d planet?
- Can _Terraform_ be attached to Thunder's Edge?
- If _Terraform_ is attached, can Thunder's Edge be explored?
- If Thunder's Edge can be explored, what happens if the _Demilitarized Zone_ is found?
- When a player claims the last expedition, if they are gaining their Breakthrough, do they roll for The Fracture before or after Thunder's Edge is placed?

## The Fracture
- Are frontier tokens placed in The Fracture when it enters play? What about when the Empyrean hero is purged?
- Say the Nekro player is placing ingress tokens. One system contains planets with a red and yellow tech skip, and another system contains a planet with a yellow tech skip. There are no other tech skips of these colours. Can the Nekro player place an ingress token in the first system for its yellow skip, and then place no token for the red skips?
- Can _Nano-Forge_ and/or _Terraform_ be attached to planets in The Fracture?
- If _Terraform_ is attached, can planets in The Fracture be explored?
- If planets in The Fracture can be explored, what happens if the _Demilitarized Zone_ is found?

## Gravity Rifts
- Does the limit of "once per ship" apply once per game or once per tactical action?
- If a player moves a ship through the same gravity rift multiple times in one action, do they still have to roll the dice multiple times?

## Neutral Units
- Does a neutral unit use SUSTAIN DAMAGE as early as possible, or only before that unit itself would be destroyed. For example, if there's a neutral destroyer and dreadnought in a system, and they take one hit, does this destroy the destroyer or damage the dreadnought?
- How are hits assigned to neutral units outside of combat (for example, SPACE CANNON)?
- What happens if there are no more neutral units of a given type available in the supply, and another is required to be placed?

## PDS
- LRR63.4 states "if a player’s PDS is ever on a planet that does not contain any of their own ground forces and contains a unit that belongs to another player, that PDS is destroyed". Does committing a ground force to a planet containing an enemy PDS and no enemy ground forces destroy that PDS before the Space Cannon Defense step?

## Space Stations
- Can _Nano-Forge_ and/or _Terraform_ be attached to a space station?
- If _Terraform_ is attached, can a space station be explored?
- If a space station can be explored, what happens if the _Demilitarized Zone_ is found?
- Does a player lose control of a space station if a neutral ship is placed in its system?
- Does a player gain control of a space station before combat against neutral units, as they will be the only real player with units there?
- Can space stations be used to cast votes during the agenda phase?

## Transactions
- Can the active player resolve two transactions simultaneously (if they don't involve the same specific component). E.g. on Player B's turn, if they have at least one trade good already, can they both give a trade good to Player A and get a trade good from Player C, in such a way that it is binding?

## Turns
- Can a player pass whenever they have an action to perform? In particular, can a player with _Fleet Logistics_ take an action, and then pass the same turn, or can a player only pass at the start of their turn? This might be relevant if a player wishes to pay another player to pass so that they can score _Prove Endurance_.

# Components

## Action Cards

### Exchange Program
- Does each player propose where the infantry will be placed before either players agree, or do players first agree to have an infantry placed somewhere, sight unseen?

### Extreme Duress
- How does this interact with _Coup D'etat_?

### Lie In Wait
- Say two players make a deal for one of them to play an action card. Previously, this would have been a binding deal. How does _Lie In Wait_ interact with this?
- Say two players make a deal for one of them to play an action card. If a third player plays _Lie in Wait_ and finds a _Sabotage_, can they cancel the played action card?

### Mercenary Contract
- If the planet becomes neutral, does it get re-explored (or does it re-relic for The Fracture planets) when a player invades later?
- What happens regarding the exhausted/readied status of a legendary planet ability card when a legendary planet is returned and then recontrolled?

### Puppets on a String
- If Yssaril plays this, and has _Transparasteel Plating_, can other players play action cards?
- _Fleet Logistics_, _Master Plan_ and Keleres Commander?
- Transactions?
- "Start/end of your turn" abilities?
- "End that player's turn" abilities?
- In general, is it the player's turn?

### Reparations
- If a player has only readied planets, and their opponent has only exhausted planets, can they play _Reparations_ for no effect (other than discarding _Reparations_)?

### Rescue
- If the ship is in a gravity rift, does it roll for it?

### Salvage
- If the defender plays _Salvage_, can the attacker perform a transaction? What if they're trying to by a _Sabotage_? If so, what if that _Sabotage_ gets cancelled by a Watcher?

### Spy
- Can a player play the _Spy_ action card on themselves, or does that count as a harmful effect, and thus would be covered by the Lucky Shot ruling?
- Can _Spy_ be played on a player with no action cards?

### War Machine
- Say a player has no resources, but they wish to follow Warfare, and use _War Machine_ to build one resource worth of units. Do they commit the strategy token before or after they play _War Machine_? In particular, if _War Machine_ gets _Sabotage_'d, do they still lose the strategy token?

## Legendary Planets

### The Galactic Council - Mecatol Rex
- Can a player discard a scored secret objective?

### Jupiter Brain - Thunder's Edge
- A previous ruling has stated that if an effect ends a player's turn, they may still use "at the end of your turn" abilities. Can they use Jupiter Brain in this manner to perform an additional action?

## Agendas

### Enforced Travel Ban
- The "For" of _Enforced Travel Ban_ is "alpha and beta wormholes have no effect during movement". Does this disable SLIPSTREAM in alpha/beta wormhole systems ("during your tactical actions, apply +1 to the move value of each of your ships that starts its movement in your home system or in a system that contains either an alpha or beta wormhole")?

## Events

### Age of Commerce
- Does _Dark Pact_ trigger if the Empyrean player gets __exactly__ the giving player's commodity value, or __at least__ this value?
- Does _Trade Agreement_ steal all of the target player's commodities, or only their printed commodity value? Also, Vuil'raith agent? Also, _Salvage_?

### Age of Exploration
- The Creuss Gate isn't a home system. Can new tiles be placed adjacent to it in Age of Exploration because of this?
- What happens when using the 5p hyperlane map with Age of Exploration? Hyperlanes removed the asymmetry from the base game "give some players starting trade goods depending on where they sit" 5p setup, but in Age of Exploration, the asymmetry seems to return. Taking the PoK Five Player map as an example, you can't physically place a tile so that it touches both tile 80 and tile 63, which puts the two players at the top of the map at a disadvantage.
- Does The Fracture block new tile placement?

### Age of Fighters
- Does Vuil'raith still capture ships they destroy? If so, are these ships purged or returned when they are spent (or blockaded)?
- If they are purged, are ships captured by The Stillness of Stars or Vortex also purged when spent?
- If a player builds a space dock under fighters that are using fleet pool, would this force the fighters out of fleet pool, thereby removing their capacity value?
- Does the Creuss commander add fighters when the Creuss player moves fighters through wormholes?

### Civilized Society
- Are the objective decks turned face up? This would impact the _Incentive Program_ agenda.
- Does the _Neuraloop_ relic have any use in a _Civilized Society_ game?
- "...instead, it ends at the end of that round's status phase" - what happens if a player would get their final victory point in the agenda phase?

### Conventions of War Abandoned
- Can a single mech cancel each bombardment hit with SUSTAIN DAMAGE, or would this require three mechs?
- Can a player purge planets they control, including planets in their own home system?
- If Mecatol Rex is purged, is tile 112 still considered the Mecatol Rex system for _Ixthian Artefact_ (and other, less important reasons)?

### Cosmic Phenomenae
- The nebulae effect says +3 to the defender "instead". Is this instead of just the +1, or does it replace the entirety of the nebula effect (i.e. including the move=1 effect)?
- The asteroid field effect says that fighters don't participate. Does this mean they cannot be assigned hits, too?

### Cultural Exchange Program
- What should a player do if they draw Suffi An, Ul the Progenitor, It Feeds on Carrion, or Sharsiss, and don't have access to the relevant abilities/components? Cry?
- Does drawing the Bastion leader suite give access to the galvanize tokens?
- What hero does a player take if they draw the Keleres? All of them?
- What leaders does a player take if they draw the Firmament/Obsidian? All of them?

### Hidden Agenda
- Can players speak to resolve non-action card abilities, such as the Xxcha player's QUASH ability, the Nekro player's GALACTIC THREAT prediction or the _Keleres Rider_?
- From Reddit: When the speaker gives the total votes, are they allowed to lie?

### Minor Factions
- If you get dealt Keleres as a Minor Faction, how do you choose which home system to use? What if somebody else that's placing after you has that faction as their minor faction?
- If you get dealt the Firmament/Obsidian as a Minor Faction, do you use the Firmament or the Obsidian home system and commander?
- Are the reference cards dealt face up or face down when setting up?
- Say a player gains control of both planets in a two-planet minor home system, gaining the commander ability. Then, two other players come in, and take one planet each. The player with the commander ability now controls zero planets in that minor home system. Do they keep the commander ability?
- Similarly, does a player keep the commander ability of a minor system that has been _Nova Seed_'d?

### Monument to the Ages
- What happens if a player wishes to place a monument, but all three are already out? Can they scuttle one they control? Can they scuttle one another player controls? If so, are commodities transferred to the new monument?
- Alice is on 8VPs with Leadership and controls two monuments. Bob is on 9VPs with Imperial and controls one monument. All monuments are one commodity short of a VP breakpoint. At the start of the status phase, who wins. Is it a) all commodities are placed simultaneously, so Alice gains 2VPs and wins with the lower initiative, or b) players resolve commodity placement as abilities, one at a time in initiative order, so Alice places one commodity, goes to 9VPs, then Bob places one commodity, goes to 10VPs, and wins?

### Weird Wormholes
- Do fighters being transported roll, or just fighters II moving under their own power?
- Do players roll for their ships in a specific order?

## Objectives

### Become a Martyr
- Generally public objectives can't be scored if you don't control every planet in your home system. If _Become A Martyr_ is a public objective (by _Classified Document Leaks_ or _Neuraloop_), can it be scored when triggered by a player losing a planet in their own home system? 

## Relics

### The Book of Latvinia
- Can a tier one (_Gravity Drive_ etc.) technology be researched when drawing the _Book of Latvinia_ by ignoring the prerequisite with a tech skip, ANALYTICAL, etc.?

### Metali Void Armaments
- Can abilities such as the Argent commander or Jol-Nar commander affect the ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE roll, since it isn't a unit performing the roll?

### Metali Void Shielding
- Say Nekro has _Metali Void Shielding_, and has infantry participating in space combat as though they were ships. Can they be damaged? How would a player indicate a damaged infantry token?

### The Silver Flame
- Can a player score _Become a Martyr_ when they purge their home system?
- Is Saar affected by the "can't score publics" clause?
- Does The Fracture enter play if a 10 is rolled?

### The Triad
- Can _The Triad_ be exhausted by _Uprising_?
- Can _The Triad_ be used to cast votes?
- Is _The Triad_ exhausted by _Maw of Worlds_?
- Does _The Triad_ count as a planet for scoring objectives?
- Can _Nano-Forge_ and/or _Terraform_ be attached to _The Triad_?
- If _Terraform_ is attached, can _The Triad_ be explored?
- Does Saar gain a trade good from SCAVENGE when they gain _The Triad_?
- Does an unknown relic fragment count as a fragment of its own type, or only as one of the other three types?
- Alternatively, if a player has multiple unknown relic fragments, can they declare that they are fragment types that don't usually exist ("here is my fuchsia relic fragment, and my lavender relic fragment, and my burnt umber relic fragment...")?

## Strategy Cards

### Imperial
- Are you required to score an objective, if possible, when you resolve the primary of Imperial? E.g. _Erect a Monument_ is out, and you have eight resources available on readied planets (which you'd rather spend on plastic and/or Leadership command tokens, since one of the resources comes from Mecatol Rex under your control). 

# Factions

- Can Argent move ships into systems that contain another player's ships?

## Last Bastion

- "Unit upgrades share a name with a unit that is printed on a player's faction sheet, but have a higher __roman numeral__" - is 4X4IC "HELIOS" V2 a unit upgrade?

## The Ghosts of Creuss

###  Wormhole Generator (Technology)
- Can wormholes be placed in The Fracture? Also applies to placing wormholes with _Creuss IFF_.
- Do neutral ships block wormhole placement?
- Followup: If Creuss wormholes are banned in The Fracture, can the _Hil Colish_ move into The Fracture?

### Particle Synthesis (Breakthrough)
- If there are multiple wormholes of the same type, do they each count?

## The Deepwrought Scholarate

### Oceanbound (Ability)
- If the Deepwrought player has all their oceans out, can they still resolve Oceanbound if they start another coexistence, so as to ready one of their oceans?
- What do Ocean Cards do?
- Can they be spent like planets for resources and influence?
- Can they be exhausted to cast votes?
- Do Ocean Cards count as planets for scoring objectives?
- Can _Nano-Forge_ and/or _Terraform_ be attached to an Ocean Card?
- If _Terraform_ is attached, can an Ocean Card be explored?
- What happens to attachments if an Ocean Card is discarded?

### Share Knowledge (Promissory Note)
- What happens if the Deepwrought player is eliminated while _Share Knowledge_ is in play? Is the promissory note immediately purged, causing the return clause not to trigger during the status phase?

### Radical Advancement (Technology)
- If the Nekro player copies this, can they return a Valefar technology as though it had the prerequisites of the technology it is currently copying?

### D.W.S. Luminous (Flagship)
- How does this interact with _Aerie Hololattice_? Priority to "cannot"?

### Doctor Carrina (Agent)
- Is it possible in any way, shape, or form for the Deepwrought player to start coexisting with the Nekro player by using Doctor Carrina?

### Ta Zern (Hero)
- When a _Valefar Assimilator_ copies a technology, does it also copy the name of that technology? I.e. if the Deepwrought player purges one of their faction techs that is being copied by a Valefar, does the Valefar also get purged?

## The Empyrean

### Void Tether (Breakthrough)
- If the Void Tether token is between two systems that both contain a wormhole, do other players consider those systems adjacent?
- Does the QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT neighbours ruling apply i.e. if Empyrean is on one side of the Void Tether token, are they neighbours and vice versa with a player on the other side?
- If one side is an anomaly, and another player activates the other side, can _Aetherstream_ be used (especially if Nekro is copying it)?
- What happens to the Void Tether tokens if the Empyrean player is eliminated?

## The Firmament & The Obsidian

### Plots Within Plots (Firmament Ability)
- What happens to a plot card if the player whose command token on it is eliminated?

### Puppets of the Blade (Firmament Ability)
- When The Firmament player purges their home planet cards, do they qualify for _Become A Martyr_?

### Malevolency (Obsidian Promissory Note)
- Does this go into the receiver's play area? If not, is it mandatory if it's in your hand at the end of the status phase?

### Captain Aroz/Aroz Hollow (Firmament/Obsidian Commander)
- If Captain Aroz causes the Firmament player to treat a planet as controlled by them, does that stop the actual controller from scoring a secret objective with it?
- When the Obsidian isn't being played, and a game effect instructs a player to gain their alliance ability (Yin breakthrough, _Mercenaries for Hire_ event), do their get the Firmament or Obsidian ability, or both, or each has its own card?

### The Reaping (Obsidian Breakthrough)
- During the status phase, would PILLAGE be triggered once or twice?

### Extract (Plot)
- Does _Extract_ trigger from effects that "replace" a player's technology (Jol-Nar hero, Deepwrought technology)

## The Emirates of Hacan

### Auto-Factories (Breakthrough)
- Can the new fleet token be used to support the newly placed ship?
- Do the ships have to survive fleet pool limits to trigger the new token?

## The Universities of Jol-Nar

### Specialised Compounds (Breakthrough)
- Can Jol-Nar use the SYNERGY to exhaust a yellow skip planet to pay for researching a green technology, or vice versa?
- Can Jol-Nar use _Psychoarchaeology_ to bypass exhausting the technology specialty when using _Specialised Compounds_?

## The Council Keleres

### Executive Order (Technology)
- Is there a functional difference between "drawing" and agenda card and "revealing" it?
- Does "immediately vote" mean that Riders, QUASH, _Political Secrets_ etc. are skipped?
- How are "this agenda phase" or "next strategy phase" abilities resolved?
- _Representative Government_ says players get straight up one vote during the agenda phase. Would players get just one vote when resolving _Executive Order_ (during the action phase), should _Representative Government_ be in play?
- _Executive Order_ doesn't describe the extra votes as "additional votes". Pending previous question, can Keleres spend trade goods and resources for more votes when _Representative Government_ is in play. 

## The L1Z1X Mindnet

### Assimilate (Ability)
- If L1Z1X gains control of a planet, do they use ASSIMILATE on any coexisting structures?

### Fealty Uplink (Breakthrough)
- Explore before, after, or player's choice?

## The Barony of Letnev

### Gravleash Maneuvers (Breakthrough)
- Is "before you roll dice" literal i.e. does it apply to AFB rolls? Does it apply to infantry II killed by Strike Wing Alphas?
- Additionally, if Letnev gets to reroll their combat dice (e.g. with MUNITIONS RESERVES), do they get to choose another ship for the bonus?
- If the Nomad player uses The Thundarian, can the Letnev player choose a different ship? This may be particularly pertinent if the original ship was destroyed by _The Crown of Thalnos_.
- Can a fast ship have its movement boosted with _Gravity Drive_, and then have this modified value copied to a slow ship?
- Conversely, can a slow ship copy a value, then get the +1 from _Gravity Drive_? This could be relevant for a ship with capacity taking a longer path to pick up some units.
- How about gravity rifts?

## The Mentak Coalition

### Pillage (Ability)
- PILLAGE is an "after". Transactions don't advance timing windows. If a player performs a transaction and goes above three trade goods, can they immediately perform another transaction to go below three trade goods (or even to zero trade goods) before PILLAGE triggers?

### Corsair (Breakthrough Unit)
- Can Nekro copy Corsair from Mentak? Can they copy Cruiser II while it's under Corsair?

## The Embers of Muaat

### Nova Seed (Hero)
- Can Muaat use _Nova Seed_ on a tile in The Fracture?

### Stellar Genesis (Breakthrough)
- If another player has units on Avernus, and Muaat moves the planet into a supernova, what happens to those units?
- Gravity Rifts?
- What happens to Avernus if Muaat is eliminated?
- What happens to Avernus if its system is _Nova Seed_'d?

## The Naalu Collective

### Z’eu Ω (Agent)
- If Naalu uses Z’eu Ω on another player, who can perform transactions during that action?
- Yssaril has _Transparasteel Plating_, and uses Clever Clever Z’eu Ω and chooses a passed player. Can that player play action cards during this action?
- Similarly, if Naalu uses Z’eu Ω and chooses Yssaril, can passed players play action cards during this action?

## The Naaz-Rokha Alliance

### Z-Grav Eidolon (Mech)
- Is flipping to a Z-Grav Eidolon a (mandatory) activated ability, or does it "just happen"? If NRA has mechs in the space area, and another player with _Assault Cannon_ attacks them, the attacker gets to resolve an ability first. If flipping is an activated ability, then NRA couldn't kill a mech for _Assault Cannon_, but if it "just happens", they could.

### Eidelon Maximum (Breakthrough Unit)
- Does the Eidelon Maximum participate in space combat when it is on a planet?
- In general, is the Eidelon Maximum treated as a ship when on a planet? Does it block other player's ship movement through the system? Can it count towards ship objectives? Can it blockade space docks?
- Can additional Eidelons Maximums be placed when the _Articles of War_ law is in play?

## The Nekro Virus

### Valefar Assimilator Z (Breakthrough)
- _Heaven's Eye_ specifies "... 1 of __your__ plots ...". Does Nekro gain a benefit from copying this?
- If there is a Valefar Z token on the Firmament player's faction sheet, what happens to this token when that faction sheet is purged to become the Obsidian?
- Does copying the _Son of Ragh_, the _Loncarra Ssodu_, the _Ouranos_ or the _Heaven's Hollow_ do anything? If so, for the _Ouranos_, would Nekro also gain the COALESCENCE faction ability?
- If there is a Valefar Assimilator Z token on the Vuil'raith faction sheet, and both _The Alastor_ and _The Terror Between_ are in the same system, who captures units when they're destroyed?
- What happens to a Valefar Assimilator Z token on a faction sheet when a player is eliminated?
- Why do you hate Creuss so much?

## The Nomad

### Field Marshal Mercer (Agent)
- The timing window for Field Marshal Mercer is "at the end of a player's turn"; should this instead be errata'd to "at the end of a player's action", to interact with _Fleet Logistics_ etc.?
- Also, is the "end of turn" window after or simultaneous with the "end of action" window (i.e. is there actually an active system during the "end of turn" window)?

## Sardakk N'orr

### G'hom Sek'kus
- You've stated in the past that _Dominus Orb_ does not allow G'hom Sek'kus to commit ground forces from systems containing the N'orr player's command tokens. You've also stated in the past that _Dominus Orb_ __can__ allow G'hom Sek'kus to commit ground forces from systems containing the N'orr player's command tokens. Could you please clarify which of these two contradictory options is the correct ruling?

## The Ral Nel Consortium

### Linkship (Unit)
- If the Ral Nel player has the PDS II unit upgrade, can their Linkships' SPACE CANNON be used to target ships in adjacent systems?

### Last Dispatch (Flagship)
- Can the _Last Dispatch_ destroy a Ral Nel ship?
- What happens if the _Last Dispatch_ kills the final ship of the Ral Nel player's opponent? Does the retreat still happen? Who wins the combat (or is it a draw)?

### Kan Kip Rel (Agent)
- How would this resolve if the Ral Nel player would go over their action card hand limit?
- If the Ral Nel player gives the action card to Yssaril, does this trigger SCHEMING?
- How does this resolve if the Yssaril player copies this agent, with regards to SCHEMING, as they would start off by drawing three action cards?

### Watchful Ojz (Commander)
- How does Watchful Ojz interact with the _Intercept_ action card, especially if the Ral Nel player is first to resolve an ability?

### Director Nel (Hero)
- Does purging Director Nel block another player from scoring _Prove Endurance_?

### Alarum (Mech)
- A planet is considered adjacent to the system that it is in. Would this allow an Alarum to pull ground forces from a different planet in the same system?
- If an Alarum pulls in another Alarum, can that new Alarum immediately pull in additional ground forces?

### Data Skimmer (Breakthrough)
- Does _Reverse Engineer_ have priority over _Data Skimmer_?
- What happens to the action cards on _Data Skimmer_ if the Ral Nel player is eliminated?

## The Crimson Rebellion

### Sundered (Ability)
- What does "cannot use wormholes" mean?
- Are they neighbours with other players?
- Can they score _Become the Gatekeeper_?
- Do they get a tech from _Wormhole Research_?
- Are they immune from destroying PDS because of _Enforced Travel Ban_?
- Can they shoot PDS II through wormholes?
- Can they use the _Creuss IFF_?
- Can they use the Creuss agent or the _Lost Star Charts_ action card?
- Does _Wormhole Reconstruction_ override SUNDERED?
- Can they use the _Ghost Ship_ action card?
- Say the Ul player gets a Sleeper token on Ahk Creuxx with their breakthrough. Then, when there are no other units on Ahk Creuxx, they activate it, and place down a PDS or mech and infantry during the activation step. Ordinarily, since this is outside the invasion step, they would instantly gain control of Ahk Creuxx. Would they do so in this case, before SUNDERED is triggered, as they would have priority as the active player?

### Incursion (Ability)
- If a system contains multiple breaches during the status phase, how many can be removed in that single status phase?
- What happens to the breach tokens if the Rebellion player is eliminated?

### Sever (Promissory Note)
- Does the wormhole still count for other non-movement game effects? E.g. DEEP SPACE CANNON, _Ghost Ship_, _Become the Gatekeeper_, SLIPSTREAM?
- What takes priority, _Sever_ or QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT?
- The box art shows the sever token covering a specific wormhole. If there are multiple wormholes in a system (Nexus, Creuss tokens, etc.), does Severing one block them all?
- If the Rebellion player is eliminated, what happens to _Sever_ and its token?

### Subatomic Splicer (Technology)
- "A player cannot produce ships in a system that contains other players’ ships". Does this apply to _Subatomic Splicer_?

## The Clans of Saar

### Floating Factory (Unit)
- Say there's a combat between Saar and Yssaril. Saar has a dreadnought and Floating Factory, and Yssaril has a cruiser. Both players produce hits. Saar uses SUSTAIN DAMAGE and Yssaril plays _Direct Hit_, destroying the dreadnought. Before Yssaril assigns the hit to their cruiser, are they blockading the Floating Factory (destroying it)?
- Also, if Saar loses their last ship in combat but then gets fighters from the Yin agent, is their Floating Factory blockaded during this time? 

### Deorbit Barrage (Breakthrough)
- Can the Saar player assign two hits to a unit with SUSTAIN DAMAGE?
- Can the Saar player assign more hits to a unit than are required to destroy it? They may wish to leave one infantry alive on the planet so as to score _Make an Example of Their World_ or some other objective via an easy ground combat at a later point.

## The Federation of Sol

### Bellum Gloriosum (Breakthrough)
- Say Sol has PRODUCTION 2, and produces a dreadnought and two infantry. Do they pay five or six resources i.e. do they combine the two infantry to pay one resource, or are they split, paying two?
- Does the ship have to survive to generate the additional PRODUCTION? Could a Sol player with zero fleet pool just build useless carriers solely to boost their infantry PRODUCTION?
- Say the Sol player has a space dock on Resculon, and they produce a carrier and many infantry. Are the infantry considered to have been produced by the carrier, which would allow them to be placed on Resculon, Corneeq, or in the space area, or are the infantry considered to have been produced solely by the space dock, meaning that they can only be placed on Resculon?

## The Titans of Ul

### Slumberstate Computing (Breakthrough)
- Is there a limit to the number of Sleeper tokens that may be placed on another player's planet?
- Does the agreement to place a Sleeper token require agreeing to a specific planet, or can the Ul player withhold that information until the token is placed on the game board?
- Are the additional action cards drawn for every instance of drawing action cards during the status phase (_Minister of Policy_ etc.), or just the cards drawn in the **Draw Action Cards** step?

## The Xxcha Kingdom

### Peace Accords (Ability)
- Can Xxcha gain control of a space station with PEACE ACCORDS?
- If so, can they do so to a space station in a system with another player's ships, causing that space station to be instantly returned, albeit exhausted?

## The Yin Brotherhood

### Indoctrination (Ability)
- Which player chooses the infantry to remove? This matters if some of the infantry present are galvanized.

### Dannel of the Tenth (Hero)
- Can infantry be committed to Mecatol Rex when the Custodians token is present?
- Can infantry be committed to planets in The Fracture?

## The Vuil'raith Cabal

### Al’raith Ix Ianovar (Breakthrough)
- Can the Vuil'raith player choose to perform a breakthrough roll first?
- If Al’raith Ix Ianovar causes The Fracture to enter play, are the ingress tokens initially placed according to the synergy colours, or the Nekro method (1 of each tech skip)?
- Can the Vuil'raith player move an ingress token into a system that already contains a different ingress token?

# Twilight's Fall

## Action Cards

### Divinity
- Can a player play both _Atomize_ and _Divinity_ when their flagship is destroyed, since they both have the same timing window?

### Ignis
- Can a player destroy their own unit, or does the "Lucky Shot" ruling still apply in Twilight's Fall?

### Manipulate
- How does this interact with _Engineer_?

### Meld
- If the combined dice result total would be, say, 13, what happens if a -1 ability is applied to the result? Would it first get reduced to 12, then get capped to 10, or would it first be capped at 10, and then get reduced to 9?

### Meteor
- How does this work if a capacity ship is destroyed by space cannon, but two players still have ships in the active system?
- How does this work if a capacity ship is destroyed outside of a tactical action e.g. by _Ignis_, or _Legacy of Ixth_?

### Reverse
- Is _Reverse_ played before or after the cards are revealed for the splice?

### Rise
- How is this resolved by a player placing fighters with a blockaded space dock?

### Scarab
- Do Singularity abilities have Nekro origins or the origins of the card they are copying (or both)?

### Thieve
- Are the two cards discarded for _Engineer_ included?

### Timestop
- Can the interrupting player play "start of turn" and/or "end of turn" abilities?
- Which of the two players can perform transactions during the interrupting action?

### Transpose
- Can a player take the ability card they just gave?

## Edicts

### Foretell
- Can the speaker choose which public objectives they reveal, knowing what cards had been peeked at?

### Legacy of Ixth
- What happens if a game effect would make the dice result 0 or 11?

## Unit Upgrades

### Guild Agents
- Does the ability trigger for each infantry moved into the system, or does it trigger only once regardless of the number of infantry moved?
- What happens if a system contains multiple players' units?

## Faction Units

### Starlancer II - Radiant Aur
- Are mechs on other planets repaired?
- If Radiant Aur has the _Stellar Genesis_ and/or the _Peace Accords_ ability, may they spend multiple strategy tokens in one timing window if they have multiple mechs out?

### Colada - The Saint of Swords
- Is "while this unit is being transported" synonymous with "while this unit is in the space area"?

### Bone Picked Clean - A Sickening Lurch
- Does the choice of player matter when capturing an infantry?

## Genomes

### Ravenous Genome
- Do the captured units serve any mechanical purpose without a Vuil'raith ability, or do they just prevent their owner from building them?

## Abilities

### Crucible
- Will Il Na Viroset apply +1 to the move value of the Enigma when it moves out of or through a gravity rift?
