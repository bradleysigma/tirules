<h1>Rules Reference</h1>
<style> .lrr > li:before, .lrr > h2 > li:before {content: '15.' counter(item, decimal);} </style>
<p>A unit with the <sc>Bombardment</sc> ability may be able to destroy another player&rsquo;s ground forces during an invasion. During the <b>Bombardment</b> step, players perform the following steps:</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
    <li><b>Step 1</b> &ndash; The active player chooses which planet each of their units that has a <sc>Bombardment</sc> ability will bombard. Then, that player rolls dice for each of those units; this is called a bombardment roll. A hit is produced for each die roll that is equal to or greater than the unit&rsquo;s <sc>Bombardment</sc> value.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>A unit&rsquo;s <sc>Bombardment</sc> ability is presented along with a unit&rsquo;s attributes on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards.</li>
        <li>The <sc>Bombardment</sc> ability is displayed as &ldquo;<sc>Bombardment</sc> X (&times;Y)&rdquo;. The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled. Not all <sc>Bombardment</sc> abilities have a (Y) value; a bombardment roll for such a unit consists of one die.</li>
        <li>Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect bombardment rolls.</li>
        <li>Multiple planets in a system may be bombarded, but a player must declare which planet a unit is bombarding before making a bombardment roll.</li>
        <li>The L1Z1X&rsquo;s <sc>Harrow</sc> ability does not affect the L1Z1X player&rsquo;s own ground forces.</li>
        <li>Planets that contain a unit with the <sc>Planetary Shield</sc> ability cannot be bombarded.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><b>Step 2</b> &ndash; The player who controls the planet that is being bombarded chooses and destroys one of their ground forces on that planet for each hit result the bombardment roll produced.</li>
    <ol><li>If a player has to assign more hits than that player has ground forces, the excess hits have no effect.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Notes</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The <b>Bombardment</b> step happens outside of combat. No combat effects may affect a bombardment roll.</li>
    <ol><li>A player cannot score a secret objective that requires them to win a combat or similar by destroying units during the <b>Bombardment</b> step.</li></ol>
    <li>Mechs may use their <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability to cancel a hit produced by a bombardment roll.</li>
    <li>Only the active player may bombard. Usually, but not always, only the active player will have ships in the system during an invasion.</li>
    <li>For notes about <sc>Harrow</sc>, see the <a href="/F_lizix">L1Z1X faction notes page</a>.</li> 
    <li>The &ldquo;0&rdquo; side of the d10 represents a result of 10.</li>
