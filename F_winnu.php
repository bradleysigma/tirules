    </ol>

<h1>Lazax Gate Folding <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>While <i>Lazax Gate Folding</i> is exhausted, the wormhole passive effect still applies if its conditions are met.</li>
    <li><i>Lazax Gate Folding</i> may cause the Mecatol Rex system to be adjacent to other systems containing an alpha or beta wormhole for all players during the Winnu player&rsquo;s tactical actions.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The Winnu player may become neighbors with other players via <i>Lazax Gate Folding</i>.</li>
        <li>Other players may use the <sc>Deep Space Cannon</sc> ability of their units in systems containing alpha or beta wormholes during the <b>Space Cannon Offense</b> step of the Winnu player&rsquo;s turn if the Mecatol Rex system is the active system.</li>
        <li>Units in the Mecatol Rex system with the <sc>Deep Space Cannon</sc> ability may use it during the <b>Space Cannon Offense</b> step of the Winnu player&rsquo;s turn if the active system contains an alpha or beta wormhole.</li>

<h1>Rickar Rickani <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Rickar Rickani may be applied to the combat that follows its unlocking.</li>
    <li>If a system meets two (or more) of the conditions listed (such as by attaching the <i>Nano&ndash;Forge</i> relic to Mecatol Rex), Rickar Rickani will only apply +2 to combat rolls, not +4 (or +6).</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Mathis Mathinus &mdash; Imperial Seal <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A player chosen to perform the secondary ability must still spend a command token from their strategy pool to do so, except for the <i>Leadership</i> strategy card and potentially the <i>Trade</i> strategy card.</li>
    <ol><li>In the case of the <i>Construction</i> strategy card, the command token is placed as required on the game board.</li></ol>
    <li>If the Winnu player chooses the <i>Trade</i> strategy card for this ability and the Winnu player chooses a player to resolve the secondary without spending a command token via the primary ability, the chosen player must resolve the secondary ability. Additionally, if the Winnu player chooses a player to resolve the secondary via the Hero&rsquo;s ability, it is optional for that player to resolve the secondary, but if they do, they must spend a strategy token to do so.</li>
    <li><i>Acquiescence &Omega;</i> cannot be triggered by this ability.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Reclaimer <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">

    <li>If the Winnu player gains control of a planet with multiple Reclaimers, they may place a structure for each one, if they may do so without exceeding the maximum number of that structure allowed on a planet.</li>
