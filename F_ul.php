<h1>Terragenesis</h1>

    </ol>

<h1>Awaken <sub></sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Only sleeper tokens present in the system when it is activated may be replaced with PDS.</li>
    <li>A sleeper token that is placed during the activation step, most commonly by using the <i>Scanlink Drone Network</i> technology and the <sc>Terragenesis</sc> ability, cannot be replaced via the <sc>Awaken</sc> ability during the same tactical action.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Coalescence <sub></sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Units placed on planets via the <sc>Coalescence</sc> ability are not committed. They cannot be assigned hits during the <b>Space Cannon Defense</b> step.</li>
    <li>If another player plays the Ul player&rsquo;s <i>Ceasefire</i> promissory note, the Ul player may still place units into the active system using their flagship or <sc>Awaken</sc> ability.</li>
    <li>Only the active player may use the <sc>Bombardment</sc> ability of their units during an invasion. As such, any ships in the active system will be unable to use their <sc>Bombardment</sc> ability unless they belong to the Ul player.</li>
    <ol><li>This prevents the L1Z1X player from using their <sc>Harrow</sc> ability.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Terraform <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Once played, <i>Terraform</i> is never returned to the Ul player.</li>
    <li>Once played, <i>Terraform</i> counts as being in the play area of the player who controls the planet.</li>
    <li>If a planet has multiple traits, the player exploring the planet chooses which of the corresponding exploration decks to draw from.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Hel&ndash;Titan <sub>(Unit)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Ul player cannot use the secondary ability of the <i>Warfare</i> strategy card to use the <sc>Production</sc> ability of a Hel&ndash;Titan.</li>
    <li>When multiple units use their <sc>Production</sc> ability, the <sc>Production</sc> value is pooled. As such, if the Ul player has two Hel&ndash;Titans in a system, they may produce two infantry for one resource, rather than two.</li>
    <li>Effects that directly move ground forces without transporting them, such as the <i>Decoy Operation</i> action card, may be used to move a Hel&ndash;Titan to another planet.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Saturn Engine <sub>(Unit)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    </ol>

<h1>Ouranos <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Only PDS present in the system when it is activated may be replaced with the <i>Ouranos</i>.</li>
    <li>A PDS that is placed during the activation step, most commonly by using the <sc>Awaken</sc> ability, cannot be replaced with the <i>Ouranos</i> during the same tactical action.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Tellurian <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Cancelling a hit cannot be used to stop an effect that directly destroys a unit.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Tungstantus <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The trade good may be spent on the units produced by the <sc>Production</sc> ability that triggered Tungstantus.</li>
    <ol><li>A trade good will not be gained unless at least one unit is produced.</li></ol>
    <li>Other effects that produce units without a unit using its <sc>Production</sc> ability will not trigger Tungstantus.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Ul the Progenitor &mdash; Geoform <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability is controlled by whichever player controls Elysium.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Hecatoncheries <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When the Ul player would place multiple PDS during a single step, they may resolve a <sc>Deploy</sc> ability to place one Hecatoncheries for any or all of those PDS.</li>
    <li>A <sc>Deploy</sc> ability may only be resolved for units in a player&rsquo;s reinforcements. If all four of the Hecatoncheries are already on the board, no Hecatoncheries may be deployed.</li>
