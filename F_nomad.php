<h1>The Company</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    </ol>

<h1>Future Sight</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Nomad player may only predict agenda outcomes via game effects that allow them to do so, e.g. rider action cards.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>The Cavalry <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>One ship is chosen. That ship retains the flagship values and abilities until it is destroyed or the combat ends.</li>
    <li>If the chosen ship does not usually have the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability, and is damaged during combat, it will remain damaged even after losing the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The damaged ship may be chosen again if <i>The Cavalry</i> is played by the same player during a future combat, regaining the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability. As it is already damaged, it will be unable to use its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability again.</li>
        <li>The damaged ship will be repaired during the status phase, regardless of if it currently has the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability.</li>
        <li>In a future combat, the damaged ship may be repaired by the <i>Duranium Armor</i> technology. It will be unable to be damaged again unless it has regained the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability.</li>
        <li>If the <i>Emergency Repairs</i> action card is played, the damaged ship will not be repaired unless it currently has the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability.</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Temporal Command Suite <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Nomad player may perform a transaction with another player even if neither player is the active player.</li>
    <ol><li><i>Temporal Command Suite</i> may allow the Nomad player to perform a transaction at a time they usually could not. For example, if the Mentak player exhausts their Suffi An agent during the strategy phase when another player gains the trade goods on the strategy card they chose, the Nomad player may use <i>Temporal Command Suite</i> and then perform a transaction with the Mentak player.</li></ol>
    <li>An agent cannot be resolved twice in one timing window. If a player&rsquo;s agent is readied immediately after resolving, it cannot immediately resolve again.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Memoria <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Only the <i>Memoria</i> is adjacent to systems with a Quantum Manipulator. Other ships cannot move between the <i>Memoria</i>&rsquo;s system and a system containing a Quantum Manipulator using this ability.</li>
    <li>Other players cannot use the <sc>Deep Space Cannon</sc> ability of units in the same system as a Quantum Manipulator against the <i>Memoria</i>, unless those units are adjacent using another adjacency method.</li>
    <li>The <i>Intimidate Council</i> objective requires the system to be adjacent to Mecatol Rex. As such, the Nomad player cannot use the <i>Memoria</i>&rsquo;s ability to score this objective. A similar prohibition applies to the <i>Learn the Secrets of the Cosmos</i> and <i>Threaten Enemies</i> objectives.</li>
    <li>All ship movement is simultaneous. The Nomad player cannot transport a Quantum Manipulator into a system, and then use that to move the <i>Memoria</i> into that system during the same movement.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Artuno the Betrayer <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the Nomad player would gain multiple trade goods one at a time, they may only put one on Artuno the Betrayer.</li>
    <li>When a player gains trade goods that were on a strategy card, they do not gain them from the supply.</li>
    <li>When the Nomad player gains trade goods that were on Artuno the Betrayer, they do not gain them from the supply.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Field Marshal Mercer <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The ground forces may be from a system with that players command token in it.</li>
    <li>The ground forces may be on a planet or in a space area.</li>
    <li>The ground forces may be from different systems.</li>
    <li>The ground forces may be placed on one or two planets.</li>
    <li>Any damaged mechs remain damaged.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>The Thundarian <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The dice are rerolled in the same round. Any effects that apply for a single round of combat remain in effect.</li>
    <li>If The Thundarian is readied, its effect may be applied again at the end of the same round of combat.</li>
    <li>The <b>Roll Dice</b> step occurs after the start of a round of combat. Any effects that may be played at the start of a round of combat cannot be played until the next round of combat.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Navarch Feng <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Producing the flagship still counts towards <sc>Production</sc> limits.</li>
    <li>The flagship still has a cost of 8</li>
    <ol>
        <li>It cannot be produced with abilities that are limited by the cost of units, such as the <i>Integrated Economy</i> technology or the Muaat player's agent.</li>
        <li>If the flagship is chosen for the <i>Scuttle</i> action card, the player gains 8 trade goods.</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Ahk&ndash;Syl Siven &mdash; Probability Matrix <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The game round ends after the agenda phase (or the status phase if the custodians token is yet to be removed from Mecatol Rex).</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Quantum Manipulator <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When a Quantum Manipulator uses its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability to cancel a hit produced against a ship, the <i>Direct Hit</i> and <i>Reflective Shielding</i> action cards cannot be played, as the Quantum Manipulator is not a ship.</li>
    <li>A Quantum Manipulator cannot be repaired by the <i>Duranium Armor</i> technology, as it is not participating in the combat.</li>
    </ol>
