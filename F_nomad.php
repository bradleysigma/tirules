<h1>The Company</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    </ol>

<h1>Future Sight</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Nomad player may only predict agenda outcomes via game effects that allow them to do so, e.g. rider action cards.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>The Cavalry <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>One ship is chosen. That ship retains the flagship&rsquo;s values and abilities until it is destroyed or the combat ends.</li>
    <li>If the chosen ship does not usually have the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability, and is damaged during combat, it will remain damaged even after losing the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The damaged ship may be chosen again if <i>The Cavalry</i> is played by the same player during a future combat, regaining the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability. As it is already damaged, it will be unable to use its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability again.</li>
        <li>The damaged ship will be repaired during the status phase, regardless of if it currently has the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability.</li>
        <li>In a future combat, the damaged ship may be repaired by the <i>Duranium Armor</i> technology. It will be unable to be damaged again unless it has regained the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability.</li>
        <li>If the <i>Emergency Repairs</i> action card is played, the damaged ship will not be repaired unless it currently has the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability.</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Temporal Command Suite <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Nomad player may perform a transaction with another player without being neighbors with that player.</li>
    <li>The Nomad player may perform a transaction with another player even if neither player is the active player.</li>
    <ol><li><i>Temporal Command Suite</i> may allow the Nomad player to perform a transaction at a time they usually could not. For example, if the Mentak player exhausts their agent, Suffi An, during the strategy phase when another player gains the trade goods on the strategy card they chose, the Nomad player may use <i>Temporal Command Suite</i> and then perform a transaction with the Mentak player.</li></ol>
    <li><i>Temporal Command Suite</i> may allow the Nomad player to perform a second transaction with another player during one turn, before or after the regular transaction.</li>
    <li>An agent cannot be resolved twice in one timing window. If a player&rsquo;s agent is readied immediately after resolving, it cannot immediately resolve again.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Memoria <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Only the <i>Memoria</i> is adjacent to systems with a Quantum Manipulator. Other ships cannot move between the <i>Memoria</i>&rsquo;s system and a system containing a Quantum Manipulator using this ability.</li>
    <li>Other players cannot use the <sc>Deep Space Cannon</sc> ability of units in the same system as a Quantum Manipulator against the <i>Memoria</i>, unless those units are adjacent using another adjacency method.</li>
    <li>The <i>Memoria</i> cannot retreat to a system containing a Quantum Manipulator, unless it is adjacent to that system using another adjacency method.</li>
    <li>The <i>Intimidate Council</i> objective requires the system to be adjacent to Mecatol Rex. As such, the Nomad player cannot use the <i>Memoria</i>&rsquo;s ability to score this objective. A similar prohibition applies to the <i>Learn the Secrets of the Cosmos</i> and <i>Threaten Enemies</i> objectives.</li>
    <li>All ship movement is simultaneous. The Nomad player cannot transport a Quantum Manipulator into a system, and then use that to move the <i>Memoria</i> into that system during the same movement.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Artuno the Betrayer <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the Nomad player would gain trade goods from multiple effects, they may only put the trade goods from one of those effects on Artuno the Betrayer.</li>
    <ol><li>For example, if the Nomad player successfully predicts the outcome of an agenda via the <i>Trade Rider</i> action card, they could put either the trade goods gained from the <i>Trade Rider</i>, or from <sc>Future Sight</sc>, but not both.</li></ol>
    <li>When a player gains trade goods that were on a strategy card, they do not gain them from the supply.</li>
    <li>When the Nomad player gains trade goods that were on Artuno the Betrayer, they do not gain them from the supply.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Field Marshal Mercer <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The ground forces may be from a system with that players command token in it.</li>
    <li>The ground forces may be on a planet or in a space area.</li>
    <li>The ground forces may be from different systems.</li>
    <li>The ground forces may be placed on one or two planets.</li>
    <li>Any damaged mechs remain damaged.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>The Thundarian <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The dice are rerolled in the same round. Any effects that apply for a single round of combat remain in effect.</li>
    <li>If The Thundarian is readied, its effect may be applied again at the end of the same round of combat.</li>
    <li>The <b>Roll Dice</b> step occurs after the start of a round of combat. Any effects that may be played at the start of a round of combat cannot be played until the next round of combat.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Navarch Feng <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Producing the flagship still counts towards <sc>Production</sc> limits.</li>
    <li>The flagship still has a cost of 8.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The flagship cannot be produced with abilities that are limited by the cost of units, such as the <i>Integrated Economy</i> technology or the Muaat player&rsquo;s agent.</li>
        <li>If the flagship is chosen for the <i>Scuttle</i> action card, the player gains 8 trade goods.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>The objective elected by the <i>Classified Document Leaks</i> agenda is a public objective, not a secret objective. Navarch Feng cannot be unlocked by scoring it.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If the <i>Classified Document Leaks</i> agenda is discarded, the elected objective is neither a public objective nor a secret objective. Navarch Feng cannot be unlocked by having scoring it.</li>
        <li>Commanders cannot become locked after being unlocked. If the Nomad player has only one scored secret objective, and it is elected by the <i>Classified Document Leaks</i> agenda, this will have no effect on Navarch Feng.</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Ahk&ndash;Syl Siven &mdash; Probability Matrix <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The game round ends after the agenda phase (or the status phase if the custodians token is yet to be removed from Mecatol Rex).</li>
    <li>The <i>Memoria</i> may transport ground forces from systems containing one of the Nomad player&rsquo;s command tokens while the ability of Ahk&ndash;Syl Siven is active.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Quantum Manipulator <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When a Quantum Manipulator uses its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability to cancel a hit produced against a ship, the <i>Direct Hit</i> and <i>Reflective Shielding</i> action cards cannot be played, as the Quantum Manipulator is not a ship.</li>
    <li>A Quantum Manipulator may use its <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability to cancel any hit produced during combat against the Nomad player&rsquo;s ships, not just hits produced by combat rolls. For example, hits produced by anti&ndash;fighter barrage rolls may be cancelled.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Effects that directly destroys a ship cannot be prevented with the ability of a Quantum Manipulator.</li>
        <li>Hits that are produced outside of combat cannot be cancelled with the ability of a Quantum Manipulator. For example, hits produced by space cannon rolls cannot be canceled.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>During a space combat, A Quantum Manipulator cannot be repaired by the <i>Duranium Armor</i> technology, as it is not participating in the combat.</li>
    </ol>
