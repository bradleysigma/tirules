<h1>Alliance</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>An <i>Alliance</i> must be played by the receiving player as soon as it is received. It cannot be kept secret.</li>
    <ol><li>If the active player receives an <i>Alliance</i>, they cannot then attempt to trade it with another player. It must be played immediately.</li></ol>
    <li><i>Alliance</i> is returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostiles acts towards the other player this turn.</li>
    <li>If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the other player&rsquo;s units (for example, the primary ability of the <i>Diplomacy</i> strategy card), this will not cause <i>Alliance</i> to be returned.</li>
    <li>Activating a system containing only a player&rsquo;s structures will still cause their <i>Alliance</i> to be returned.</li>

    <li>If a system containing only a player&rsquo;s ground forces or structures is activated, that player may still play the active player&rsquo;s <i>Ceasefire</i>.</li>
    <li><i>Ceasefire</i> does not prevent a player from producing or placing units in the active system.</li>
