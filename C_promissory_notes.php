<h1>Alliance</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>An <i>Alliance</i> must be played by the receiving player as soon as it is received. It cannot be kept secret.</li>
    <ol><li>If the active player receives an <i>Alliance</i>, they cannot then attempt to trade it with another player. It must be played immediately.</li></ol>
    <li><i>Alliance</i> is returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the other player this turn.</li>
    <li>If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the other player&rsquo;s units (for example, the primary ability of the <i>Diplomacy</i> strategy card), this will not cause <i>Alliance</i> to be returned.</li>
    <li>Activating a system containing only a player&rsquo;s structures will still cause their <i>Alliance</i> to be returned.</li>

    <ol class="note">
    <li>The active player may still use the <sc>Space Cannon</sc> ability of any units during the <b>Space Cannon Offense</b> step of the tactical action.</li>
    <li>If a player has units in the active system from before the tactical action in which their <i>Ceasefire</i> is played, those units will remain in the active system.</li>
    <li>If the active player already has units with capacity in the active system, they may transport ground forces on planets in that system into the space area of that system. Those units may then be committed to invade a planet during this tactical action.</li>
    <li>If a system containing only a player&rsquo;s ground forces or structures is activated, that player may still play the active player&rsquo;s <i>Ceasefire</i>.</li>
    <li><i>Ceasefire</i> does not prevent a player from producing or placing units in the active system.</li>
