<h1>Rules Reference</h1>
<style> .lrr > li:before, .lrr > h2 > li:before {content: '36.' counter(item, decimal);} </style>
<p>A fighter token functions as a plastic fighter unit for all game purposes.</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
    <li>When producing a fighter unit, a player can use a fighter token from the supply instead of a plastic piece.</li>
    <li>Players can replace their plastic fighters with tokens at any time.</li>
    <li>If a player ever has a fighter token in a system that does not contain one of their plastic fighters, that player must replace it with a plastic fighter from their reinforcements.</li>
    <ol><li>If the player cannot replace the token, the unit is destroyed.</li></ol>
    <li>Fighter tokens come in values of one and three. A player can swap between these tokens as necessary.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Notes</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>As each player only has ten plastic fighter figures, a player cannot have fighters in more than ten systems.</li>
    <li>Players may also swap fighter tokens for plastic pieces at any time.</li>
    <li>Fighter tokens are not component limited.</li>
    <li>A future rule change will have any unaccompanied fighter tokens removed, instead of destroyed.</li>
    </ol>
