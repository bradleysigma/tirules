However, if another player then resolves an ability that reduces the number of non&ndash;ships the Naaz&ndash;Rokha player has in the active system to less than three, the Naaz&ndash;Rokha player will no longer be able to resolve the <i>Assault Cannon</i> technology ability. </li>
    </ol>
    <li>Any effect that may target ships or non&ndash;fighter ships may target a Z&ndash;Grav Eidolon.</li>
    <li>A Z&ndash;Grav Eidolon is still a ground force and a mech.</li>
