<p>Hyperlanes are tiles that are used in some game board setups to create adjacency of system tiles that are not touching each other.</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
    <li>Systems that are connected by lines drawn across one or more hyperlane tiles are adjacent for all purposes.</li>
    <li>Hyperlane tiles are not systems. They cannot have units on them and they cannot be targets for effects or abilities.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Notes</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the edge of a system tile is touching a hyperlane tile, that edge does not cause that system tile to be on the edge of the game board.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>When using the five&ndash; and seven&ndash;player hyperlane setups, the system tile in the center of the ring of hyperlanes is not on the edge of the game board.</li>
        <li>When using the seven&ndash; and eight&ndash;player alternate setups, only the system tiles designated as &ldquo;Ring 3&rdquo; and home systems are on the edge of the game board, along with the Creuss home system and the wormhole nexus.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>&ldquo;Adjacent for all purposes&rdquo; includes:</li>
    <ol>
        <li><sc>Deep Space Cannon</sc>.</li>
        <li>Movement.</li>
        <li>Neighbors.</li>
        <li>Any other game effect that specifies adjacent systems.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Hyperlanes on the same tile that converge at a point on the tile edge are not connected. For example, with the &ldquo;Five&ndash;Player Galaxy Setup (With Hyperlanes)&rdquo; in the <i>Prophecy of Kings</i> Map Appendix, the hyperlanes on tile 87A do not connect tiles 39 and 63, and the hyperlanes on tile 88A do not connect tiles 41 and 80.</li>
    </ol>
