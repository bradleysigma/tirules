    <li>The produced units must be paid for.</li>
    <li>No unit is using its <sc>Production</sc> ability. The <i>Sarween Tools</i> technology and similar effects will not allow a more expensive ship to be produced.</li>

<h1>Magmus <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the Muaat player spends multiple tokens from their strategy pool (e.g. for the <i>Lead From the Front</i> objective), they gain that many trade goods, one at a time.</li>
    <li>If the Muaat player uses the ability of the <i>Scepter of Emelpar</i> relic, they will be unable to benefit from the ability of Magmus.</li>

    <ol class="note">
    <li>Any method of movement is sufficient to trigger this ability, not only tactical action movement (e.g. a retreat).</li>
    <li>Any command tokens and the Muaat player&rsquo;s units on the replaced system tile are transferred to the new supernova tile.</li>
    <li>The Muaat player&rsquo;s units may exist in and move out of the supernova system, even if the Muaat player does not own <i>Magmus Reactor</i>.</li>
    <li>If the Muaat player owns <i>Magmus Reator &Omega;</i>, and resolves this ability during a tactical action, they will be able to produce units during the <b>Production</b> step, if the Muaat player still has units in the system during the production step.</li>
