<h1>Fires of the Gashlai <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If a player already owns their war sun unit upgrade technology, they cannot play <i>Fires of the Gashlai</i>.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Magmus Reactor <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The war sun must be in the system prior to the use of <sc>Production</sc> to gain the trade good.</li>
    <li>The trade good is gained after the use of <sc>Production</sc>; it cannot be used to pay for the produced units.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Magmus Reactor &Omega; <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the Muaat player has a unit is a system containing a supernova, they cannot be eliminated.</li>

<h1>Umbat <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The produced units must be paid for.</li>
    <li>No unit is using its <sc>Production</sc> ability. The <i>Sarween Tools</i> technology and similar effects will not allow a more expensive ship to be produced.</li>
    <li>If ground forces are produced, they may be placed in the space area or on a planet the player controls in the system with their war sun or flagship.</li>
    <li>If the Naalu or Yin players are chosen, and choose to produce fighters or infantry, they will only be able to produce two of those units; their commander will have no effect.</li>
    <ol><li>If the <i>Regulated Conscription</i> law is in play, then that player may use their commander to produce two units for one resource when resolving Umbat.</li></ol>
    </ol>

<h1>Magmus <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the Muaat player spends multiple tokens from their strategy pool (e.g. for the <i>Lead From the Front</i> objective), they gain that many trade goods, one at a time.</li>
    <li>If the Muaat player uses the ability of the <i>Scepter of Emelpar</i> relic, they will be unable to benefit from the ability of Magmus.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Adjudicator Ba&rsquo;al &mdash; Nova Seed <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Any method of movement is sufficient to trigger this ability, not only tactical action movement. For example, the Muaat player may trigger <i>Nova Seed</i> when they retreat.</li>
    <ol><li>If the Mahact player moves the Muaat player&rsquo;s war sun via the use of their <i>Benediction</i> hero ability, the Muaat player cannot trigger <i>Nova Seed</i>.</li></ol>
    <li>Any command tokens, frontier tokens and the Muaat player&rsquo;s units on the replaced system tile are transferred to the new supernova tile. Any Creuss wormhole tokens are returned to the Creuss player. All other tokens are purged.</li>
    <li>The Muaat player&rsquo;s units may exist in and move out of the supernova system, even if the Muaat player does not own <i>Magmus Reactor</i>.</li>
    <li>If the Muaat player owns <i>Magmus Reactor &Omega;</i>, and resolves this ability during a tactical action, they will be able to produce units during the <b>Production</b> step, if the Muaat player still has units in the system.</li>
    <li><i>Nova Seed</i> cannot target the home system of an eliminated player.</li>
    <li><i>Nova Seed</i> may target the Creuss Gate (tile 17) or the Wormhole Nexus (tile 82).</li>
