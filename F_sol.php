<h1>Military Support <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li><i>Military Support</i> is played before the Sol player may use <i>Orbital Drop</i>.</li>
    <li><i>Military Support</i> may be played the turn the Sol player passes.</li>
    <li><i>Military Support</i> may be played when the Sol player has no command tokens in their strategy pool.</li>
    <li>A player may receive <i>Military Support</i> in a transaction during the Sol player&rsquo;s turn. If received at the start of the Sol player&rsquo;s turn, that player may play it immediately.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The active player may perform a transaction with each other player at most once per turn. As such, a player cannot receive <i>Military Support</i> more than once per turn.</li>
        <li>If a player received <i>Military Support</i> on a previous turn, they may play it at the start of the Sol player&rsquo;s turn, and immediately perform a transaction with the Sol player to regain it. However, <i>Military Support</i> cannot be played twice in one timing window. The active player cannot play <i>Military Support</i> again until the next Sol player&rsquo;s turn.</li>

    <li>If the Sol player chooses one of the L1Z1X player&rsquo;s Annihilator mechs on a different planet or in the space area, then this ability applies to dice rolls for that unit&rsquo;s bombardment rolls when the L1Z1X player uses their <sc>Harrow</sc> ability.</li>

    <ol class="note">
    <li>If an invasion involves ground combat on multiple planets, an infantry will be placed on each.</li>
    <li>The start of ground combat occurs after the <b>Space Cannon Defense</b> step. If all of the ground forces committed to a planet are destroyed in that step, then the ground combat will be skipped on that planet, and this ability will not trigger.</li>
