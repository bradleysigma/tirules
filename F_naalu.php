<h1>Telepathic</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The Naalu player retains the Naalu 0 token, even if an effect such as the <i>Imperial Arbiter</i> law causes them to lose the strategy card it was on. The Naalu player will place the Naalu 0 token on another strategy card in this scenario.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Foresight</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Using <sc>Foresight</sc> is not a retreat. As such, it cannot be cancelled with the <i>Intercept</i> action card.</li>
    <li>Fighters are moved without being transported. Ground forces may be transported.</li>
    <li>The Naalu player cannot use <sc>Foresight</sc> to move into a nebula or supernova.</li>
    <ol><li>The Naalu player may use <sc>Foresight</sc> to move into an asteroid field only if they own the <i>Antimass Deflectors</i> technology.</li></ol>
    <li>If the Naalu player uses <sc>Foresight</sc> to move out of a gravity rift, they will have to roll for removal.</li>
    <ol><li>If all ships are removed, the strategy token will still be placed in the destination system.</li></ol>
    <li>After moving, capacity and fleet pool limits apply in the destination system.</li>
    <li>If the destination system already contains a Naalu command token, the command token from the Naalu player&rsquo;s strategy pool is instead placed in their reinforcements.</li>
    <li>After resolving <sc>Foresight</sc>, play continues to the <b>Space Cannon Offense</b> step. Only the active player&rsquo;s ships in the active system may be assigned hits.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Gift of Prescience <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The player with <i>Gift of the Prescience</i> retains the Naalu 0 token, even if an effect such as the <i>Imperial Arbiter</i> law causes them to lose the strategy card it was on. That player will place the Naalu 0 token on another strategy card in this scenario.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Neuroglaive <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The active player must meet fleet pool limits in all systems that contain their ships before they may proceed to the <b>Movement</b> step.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Hybrid Crystal Fighter <sub>(Unit)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    </ol>

<h1>Matriarch <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The committed fighters are returned to the space area when combat ends, and thus will not be on the planet for the <b>Establish Control</b> step. If the Naalu player does not commit at least one ground force to a planet and have it survive the combat, they will be unable to gain control of that planet, and the ground combat will end in a draw.</li>
    <li>Any structures on the planet will not be destroyed if the Naalu player committed no ground forces.</li>
    <li>The <i>Daxive Animators</i> technology will not allow the Naalu player to gain control of a planet without committing a ground force.</li>
    <li>The committed fighters may be assigned hits during the <b>Space Cannon Defense</b> step.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Z&rsquo;eu <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    </ol>

<h1>M&rsquo;aban <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When producing units, the Naalu player must produce all the units they intend to produce before they may unlock their M&rsquo;aban. M&rsquo;aban cannot be applied to the instance of producing the units that unlocks it.</li>
    <ol><li>For example, before production, the Naalu player has ten fighters on the game board. They pay two resources during production. They cannot produce two fighters, unlock M&rsquo;aban, then produce three more fighters. Instead, they would produce all four fighters, and then unlock M&rsquo;aban.</li></ol>
    <li>If the <i>Regulated Conscription</i> law is in play, the Naalu player may produce two fighters for one resource. This will count one towards their <sc>Production</sc> limit.</li>
    <li>If a game effect instructs the Naalu player to produce ships without using the <sc>Production</sc> ability, they may only produce additional fighters if that game effect allows them to produce fighters.</li>
    <li>The Naalu player may choose to produce one fighter for one resource. If they do, they may produce one additional fighter.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>The Oracle &mdash; C&ndash;Radium Geometry <sub>(Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Each other player chooses which promissory note they give the Naalu player.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Iconoclast <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>The +1 will not apply to an opponent who has a relic but zero relic fragments.</li>
