<h1>Devour</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When an opponent&rsquo;s Infantry II is destroyed during combat, the Vuil&rsquo;raith player captures an infantry token, and the opponent rolls for resurrection, placing the destroyed infantry on the Infantry II unit upgrade card if successful.</li>
    <li>The Vuil&rsquo;raith player cannot capture the Ul player&rsquo;s Hel Titan PDS.</li>
    <li>For additional information, see the <a href="/R_capture">Capture rules reference page</a>.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Amalgamation</h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the Vuil&rsquo;raith player produces multiple units, their <sc>Amalgamation</sc> ability may be applied to each.</li>
    <li>If the Vuil&rsquo;raith player has captured their own units, they may use their <sc>Amalgamation</sc> ability when producing a unit of that type, even of they have no other units of that type in their reinforcements.</li>
    <li><sc>Amalgamation</sc> does not change the cost of the produced units, only the resources spent.</li>
    <ol><li>If the Vuil&rsquo;raith player uses the ability of the <i>Integrated Economy</i> technology, <sc>Amalgamation</sc> will have no effect on the limit to the units they may build.</li></ol>
    <li>The Vuil&rsquo;raith player produces one fighter or infantry without spending resources for each captured fighter or infantry they spend.</li>
    <li>If the Vuil&rsquo;raith player has the Naalu or Yin player&rsquo;s <i>Alliance</i> promissory note, they may spend one resource for one fighter or infantry, but spend a captured unit instead of that resource, then get one additional fighter or infantry for no cost, which will not count towards their production limit.</li>

<h1>Crucible <sub>(Promissory Note)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Each gravity rift will still provide its usual +1 to each ship&rsquo;s move value.</li>
    <li><i>Crucible</i> will provide an additional +1 to each ship&rsquo;s move value, which will not increase if that ship moves through two or more gravity rifts.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>A ship that moves through or out of no gravity rifts will apply +0 to its move value.</li>
        <li>A ship that moves through or out of one gravity rift will apply +2 to its move value.</li>
        <li>A ship that moves through or out of two gravity rifts will apply +3 to its move value.</li>
        <li>A ship that moves through or out of three gravity rifts will apply +4 to its move value.</li>
        <li>And so on.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>If a ship could move from its current system to the active system through a gravity rift if its move value were +2, it may do so using <i>Crucible</i>. This is true even if that ship could not reach the gravity rift without <i>Crucible</i>.</li>
    <ol><li>For example, consider a series of systems X&ndash;S&ndash;G&ndash;Y. Only systems connected by a &ldquo;&ndash;&rdquo; are adjacent. System &ldquo;G&rdquo; is a gravity rift. Systems &ldquo;X&rdquo;, &ldquo;S&rdquo; and &ldquo;Y&rdquo; are standard systems with no movement restrictions. A ship with a move value of one is in system &ldquo;X&rdquo;. Were it to have +2 to its movement value, it could reach system &ldquo;Y&rdquo;. Currently, that ship may reach only system &ldquo;S&rdquo;. Despite this, if its owner activated system &ldquo;Y&rdquo; and played <i>Crucible</i>, the ship could move to that system.</li></ol>
    <li>If the active player received <i>Crucible</i> on a previous turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Vuil&rsquo;raith player to regain it. However, <i>Crucible</i> cannot be played twice in one timing window. The active player cannot play <i>Crucible</i> again until their next turn.</li>
    <li>Any deal between the Vuil&rsquo;raith player and another player regarding when <i>Crucible</i> will be played, if made before <i>Crucible</i> is exchanged, is non&ndash;binding.</li>
    <li>If a player plays both <i>Crucible</i> and the <i>Nav Suite</i> action card during the same tactical action, they will still apply +1 to the move value of their ships that move through or out of a gravity rift.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Vortex <sub>(Technology)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>A unit is not adjacent to the system it is in; the <i>Vortex</i> ability cannot target a ground force on another planet in the same systems as one of the Vuil&rsquo;raith player&rsquo;s Dimensional Tears, unless there is a second space dock in an adjacent system.</li>
    <li><i>Vortex</i> cannot be used if there are no units that can be targeted.</li>
    <li>If a player has all their units of a particular type on the board, other than fighters or infantry, that type of unit belonging to that player cannot be targeted.</li>
    <li>If another player is blockading a Dimensional Tear, their units cannot be targeted with <i>Vortex</i>.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Dimensional Tear <sub>(Unit)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>This system is a gravity rift, and thus an anomaly.</li>
    <ol><li>This system qualifies for the <i>Make History</i> and similar such objectives.</li></ol>
    <li>If a ship moves through or out of multiple gravity rifts, and/or the same gravity rift multiple times, each instance will provide a +1 to movement.</li>
    <ol><li>For example, consider a series of systems A&ndash;B&ndash;C&ndash;M. Only systems connected by a &ldquo;&ndash;&rdquo; are adjacent. Systems &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;B&rdquo; and &ldquo;C&rdquo; have dimensional tears, while system &ldquo;M&rdquo; does not. The Vuil&rsquo;raith player has a carrier with move one in system &ldquo;C&rdquo; and a ground force in system &ldquo;A&rdquo;. They could activate system &ldquo;M&rdquo; and move the carrier along the path &ldquo;C&rdquo; &rarr; &ldquo;B&rdquo; &rarr; &ldquo;A&rdquo; &rarr; &ldquo;B&rdquo; &rarr; &ldquo;C&rdquo; &rarr; &ldquo;M&rdquo;, picking up the ground force from system &ldquo;A&rdquo;. This path would make the carriers move value 1+5, which is more than enough for this movement.</li></ol>
    <li>Multiple Dimensional Tears in a single system have no additional effects.</li>
    <li>If a Dimensional Tear is in a system that is normally a gravity rift (e.g. the Cormund system), the Vuil&rsquo;raith player will not have to roll for removal when moving out of or through that system. There are no additional effects.</li>
    <li>If a Dimensional Tear is in a system with a Nebula, then the +1 to move values will be applied after the nebula sets each ship&rsquo;s move value to 1.</li>
    <li>If the Dimensional Tear plastic figure is destroyed or removed, the Dimensional Tear token is also removed.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>The Terror Between <sub>(Flagship)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>When <i>The Terror Between</i> is destroyed, it still captures units that were destroyed at the same time.</li>
    <ol><li>Using the <sc>Sustain Damage</sc> ability of units is done before remaining hits are assigned. As such, if <i>The Terror Between</i> is destroyed by a <i>Direct Hit</i> action card, units destroyed by being assigned hits in the same round of combat, or from the same pool of <sc>Space Cannon</sc> hits, will not be captured.</li></ol>
    <li>If ships are destroyed outside of combat, those ships will still be captured by <i>The Terror Between</i>.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>The Stillness of Stars <sub>(Agent)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If a player loses their commodities immediately after replenishing them, most commonly via that player&rsquo;s <i>Trade Agreement</i> promissory note, the Vuil&rsquo;raith player may still target them. If they do, they still use that player&rsquo;s full commodity value to determine which units may be captured.</li>
    <li>The Vuil&rsquo;raith player cannot capture a unit without a cost. Notably, they cannot capture a PDS, a space dock, or a war sun of a player without their war sun unit upgrade.</li>
    <li>If the Vuil&rsquo;raith player chooses to capture a fighter or infantry, they will capture one, not two.</li>
    <li>When the primary ability of the <i>Trade</i> strategy card is resolved, the Vuil&rsquo;raith player must choose if they will use The Stillness of Stars or not after the active player has replenished their commodities, but before players are chosen to perform the secondary ability without spending a command token.</li>
    <li>When the secondary ability of the <i>Trade</i> strategy card is resolved, the Vuil&rsquo;raith player must choose if they will use The Stillness of Stars or not after the current player has replenished their commodities, but before the next player has decided if they will spend a command token to perform the secondary.</li>
    <li>When The Stillness of Stars converts a player&rsquo;s commodities to trade goods, those trade goods are not treated as being gained for the purpose of triggering other abilities. In particular, the Mentak player&rsquo;s <sc>Pillage</sc> faction ability is not triggered by this ability.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>That Which Molds Flesh <sub>(Commander)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    </ol>

<h1>It Feeds on Carrion &mdash; Dimensional Anchor<sub> (Hero)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>Units captured while resolving <i>Dimensional Anchor</i> are not destroyed.</li>
    <li>If a player&rsquo;s units are blockading one of the Vuil&rsquo;raith player&rsquo;s Dimensional Tears, dice will not be rolled for that player&rsquo;s units when resolving <i>Dimensional Anchor</i>.</li>
    <li>Each non&ndash;fighter ship affected will roll only once, regardless of how many Dimensional Tears it is adjacent to.</li>
    <li>The player that owns the ground forces and fighters chooses which are removed. They are not assigned to particular ships beforehand.</li>
    <li>If the Nekro player has used a <i>Valefar Assimilator</i> faction technology to copy Dimensional Tear II, ships in systems containing or adjacent to the Nekro player&rsquo;s space docks will also have to roll for capture when resolving <i>Dimensional Anchor</i>. This includes the Nekro player&rsquo;s own ships.</li>
    </ol>

<h1>Reanimator <sub>(Mech)</sub></h1>
    <ol class="note">
    <li>If the Vuil&rsquo;raith player owns the Infantry II unit upgrade technology, and one is destroyed during ground combat on a planet with a Reanimator, the Vuil&rsquo;raith player captures an infantry token, and they roll for resurrection, placing the destroyed infantry on the Infantry II unit upgrade card if successful.</li>
    <li>If the Vuil&rsquo;raith player&rsquo;s infantry on a planet with a Reanimator are destroyed outside of combat, such as with the <i>Plague</i> action card, those infantry will be captured.</li>
    </ol>
